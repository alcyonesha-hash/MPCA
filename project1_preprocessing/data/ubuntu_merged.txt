[2024-01-01 00:06] <Guddu> PeGaSuS, sem For some reason my Ubuntu although connected using ethernet cable acquired a IP using only the WIFi Interface. How can i set this right?
[2024-01-01 00:06] <oerheks> some routers have an MAC filter...
[2024-01-01 00:06] <oerheks> to assign staticf ip, lan or wireless
[2024-01-01 00:07] <Guddu> oerheks, I just saw that. I assigned a static one for my Wifi mac. But I am looking also for a way to have a IP for my Ethenernet interface
[2024-01-01 04:31] <Gudddu> I feel; that my cron is not working.
[2024-01-01 04:31] <Gudddu> */5 * * * /home/ubuntu/update_dns.sh
[2024-01-01 04:31] <Gudddu> This was supposed to execute every 5 minutes
[2024-01-01 04:34] <AzBukiVedi> Ð¡ ÐÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¼ 2024 ÐÐ¾Ð´Ð¾Ð¼!
[2024-01-01 04:38] <Gudddu> Git it. I was missing the right syntax.
[2024-01-01 05:50] <nico_> I am currently running an OEM kernel, but recent pkg installs tell me that I'll be getting upgraded to a generic kernel.  I'm guessing when I reboot I'm going to have some issues.
[2024-01-01 06:00] <kotgc> Hello, would Ubuntu people recommend Rsync or Vimdiff to check directories and their files?
[2024-01-01 06:04] <kotgc> ...or maybe rdiff (apparently a mix or rsync and vimdiff)?

[2024-01-01 06:49] <marcopolo> Guys , can you make apt show deb packages instead of snaps  ?
[2024-01-01 06:50] <ravage> apt only show apt
[2024-01-01 06:50] <marcopolo> it seems like apt repositories only show snaps
[2024-01-01 06:50] <ravage> no
[2024-01-01 06:51] <marcopolo> In software center there are only snaps packages
[2024-01-01 06:51] <marcopolo> Or is there a deb package repository ?
[2024-01-01 06:52] <ravage> apt search
[2024-01-01 06:53] <ravage> https://packages.ubuntu.com/
[2024-01-01 06:53] <marcopolo> it says transitional package to snap
[2024-01-01 06:54] <ravage> that is probably firefox then
[2024-01-01 06:54] <marcopolo> no its chromium
[2024-01-01 06:54] <ravage> or that
[2024-01-01 06:54] <ravage> ubuntu does not provide deb versions of those 2 packages
[2024-01-01 07:25] <kotgc> Solved, by using Meld.

[2024-01-01 11:56] <Sarcastro> Hello, I was hoping someone might be able to help with an issue. Ruby adds the same 3 lines to my .bashrc file in an endless loop when I ssh into Ubuntu  ( # Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems    export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"   export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH ) and I don't even see the prompt until I hit ^C.

[2024-01-01 14:31] <ouzel8> Hi everyone!
[2024-01-01 14:31] <ouzel8> I have installed Ubuntu in a HyperV VM.
[2024-01-01 14:33] <CosmicDJ> ouzel8: great
[2024-01-01 14:34] <ouzel8> I have encountered an issue with networking.
[2024-01-01 14:34] <ouzel8> It is configured with static IP, and the VM with an external networked switch (i.e. shares the hosts NIC).
[2024-01-01 14:35] <ouzel8> I have encountered issues connecting to the VM.
[2024-01-01 14:37] <ouzel8> I can connect from the host, but when connect from other devices on the LAN, I cannot connect (furthermore ping also result in timing out).
[2024-01-01 14:37] <ouzel8> I have observed an exception in which I can connect one of the devices on the network.
[2024-01-01 14:38] <ouzel8> But from other devices, including the network router, I cannot find, or connect to the host.
[2024-01-01 14:40] <ouzel8> Can anyone assist in explain likely causes for the problem
[2024-01-01 14:42] <ouzel8> Also I have check the firewall status and its inactive.
[2024-01-01 14:51] <oerheks> sounds like not an ubuntu issue, but windows networking with that external switch?
[2024-01-01 14:51] <JanC> or Windows host networking internally
[2024-01-01 14:52] <JanC> assuming the VM gets an IP address at all, of course
[2024-01-01 14:53] <JanC> also, are the host & guest IP address in the same subnet?
[2024-01-01 14:53] <ouzel8> FYI, I confirm I can find, and connect to the host from any other device.
[2024-01-01 14:54] <ouzel8> yes
[2024-01-01 15:02] <Yakov> I need to add some script to be called on my system load
[2024-01-01 15:03] <arraybolt3> Yakov: Does it require root privileges? If not, write the script, then in your ~/.profile file, add a line that runs the script.
[2024-01-01 15:04] <arraybolt3> If it does need root privileges, write the script, install it into /usr/local/bin, and write a oneshot systemd unit for it. An example of this can be found here: https://discourse.lubuntu.me/t/enabling-ram-compression-on-lubuntu/3323
[2024-01-01 15:04] <Yakov> ty
[2024-01-01 15:33] <charles_> Does anyone know how to cause the text editor Nano, to show the whole line of text , I think they call it scrolling?
[2024-01-01 15:35] <leftyfb>  charles_ https://blog.wplauncher.com/line-wrapping-in-nano-editor/
[2024-01-01 15:36] <charles_> thanks leftyfb!
[2024-01-01 15:38] <PeGaSuS> still, be careful with line wrapping when copying text, because what's on the next line is copied as a newline
[2024-01-01 15:44] <charles_> interesting, PeGaSuS
[2024-01-01 15:45] <PeGaSuS> and be especially careful when editing config files or soft-wrap might break them
[2024-01-01 15:45] <charles_> usually on Nano I send out blocks, by the command Ctrl+O, that is offer to make a new file, do  you think doing that the scrolled lines might appear as separate lines?  If it does it's a good thing to beware of
[2024-01-01 15:48] <PeGaSuS> I don't think so, because the wrap is just a visual artifact. it affects copying text but not saving the file, iirc
[2024-01-01 15:49] <charles_> ok cool.   hmm might make a difference though, if I'm copying and pasting within the document in Nano, for example Ctrl+U [cut] then Ctrol+U [paste] maybe then it would paste them as separate lines?
[2024-01-01 15:50] <PeGaSuS> just disable wrapping before saving the file (if it's a config file) and do a quick check to avoid surprises
[2024-01-01 15:52] <PeGaSuS> I don't think so. I rememer it only affected copy/paste when selecting with the mouse and using Ctrl+Shift+C/V
[2024-01-01 15:53] <PeGaSuS> as far as nano is aware, when you use Ctrl+K/U the file doesn't have lines warpped
[2024-01-01 15:53] <PeGaSuS> wrapped*
[2024-01-01 15:58] <CYB3RATTACK> Bye.
[2024-01-01 16:09] <BluesKaj> Happy New Year to all
[2024-01-01 16:10] <jailbreak> Happy new year BluesKaj :)
[2024-01-01 16:11] <BluesKaj> Happy New Year jailbreak :-)
[2024-01-01 17:10] <Tabmow> My DHCP server is set with a domain search that works fine on Windows, but doesn't seem to work on my ubuntu machine. Where can I double check that it is setting it correctly?
[2024-01-01 17:13] <rbox> Tabmow: what "doesn't work"
[2024-01-01 17:18] <Tabmow> My local domain is .local - if I ping blah.local it works, but if I ping blah it does not.
[2024-01-01 17:19] <rbox> .local is gonna conflict with multicast dns
[2024-01-01 17:19] <rbox> very bad choice for a domain
[2024-01-01 17:19] <Tabmow> That was an example
[2024-01-01 17:19] <rbox> what does /etc/resolv.conf say
[2024-01-01 17:20] <Tabmow> It has 'search .'
[2024-01-01 17:20] <rbox> thats weird
[2024-01-01 17:20] <Tabmow> Should the DHCP lease be changing that automatically?
[2024-01-01 17:20] <rbox> yes
[2024-01-01 17:21] <rbox> that whole file shoudl be generated
[2024-01-01 17:21] <Tabmow> Yeah I figured - the nameserver is 127.0.0.53 so I'm guessing it uses resolved right?
[2024-01-01 17:22] <rbox> it uses wahtever is listening on the ip/port
[2024-01-01 17:22] <Tabmow> resolvectl status mentions the correct default gw and dns server that my dhcp lease is giving but doesn't say anything about search domains
[2024-01-01 17:23] <rbox> it should list 'dns domain'
[2024-01-01 17:24] <Tabmow> It doesn't anywhere.... strange.
[2024-01-01 17:38] <tester> hello
[2024-01-01 17:38] <oerheks>
[2024-01-01 17:39] <tester> hello
[2024-01-01 17:39] <tester> anyone the fuck here eeeEE?
[2024-01-01 17:39] <tester> hellooo
[2024-01-01 17:40] <tester> some user hacker has entered and that is men, no one wana speeak?
[2024-01-01 17:40] <tomreyn> tester: please stop
[2024-01-01 17:40] <oerheks> we tend to wait for a support issue, tester
[2024-01-01 17:40] <tester> ok who am i speaking to human or bot?
[2024-01-01 17:40] <oerheks> and happy NY, many are not active today
[2024-01-01 17:41] <tomreyn> tester: if you have an ubuntu question, you are welcome to ask that, and if you'll see someone responding then it'll be a human, possibly asking a bot to give a pre-written response.
[2024-01-01 17:41] <tester> im going to setup my hidden service to the web with hexchat but first i want this to see if this work, because many months i tried fixing these issues and it hasn't work, fucking tor slow and fucking hexchat
[2024-01-01 17:42] <oerheks> keep the language family friendly, thanks.
[2024-01-01 17:42] <tester> ah okay so this is ubuntu channel okok
[2024-01-01 17:43] <tomreyn> tester: the channel /topic has links to guidelines you should read to see what we like and dislike here
[2024-01-01 17:44] <tester> tired of encountering issues with hexchat, so tired people here
[2024-01-01 17:45] <tester> anyway leaving, thank you for interactions users goodbye
[2024-01-01 17:45] <oerheks> i guess you get a better result when you register with #libera
[2024-01-01 18:01] <cbreak> I've switched to irssi, it's quite nice once configured, apt install irssi, but it's CLI
[2024-01-01 18:51] <cryptonector> I am currently running an OEM kernel, but recent pkg installs tell me that I'll be getting upgraded to a generic kernel.  I'm guessing when I reboot I'm going to have some issues.  Is that so?
[2024-01-01 18:54] <arraybolt3> cryptonector: Potentially, but I would guess it will *probably* be OK. You can see what the difference is between OEM and generic kernels here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/OEMKernel
[2024-01-01 18:56] <arraybolt3> Depending on what OEM you're using, an upgrade from an OEM kernel to a generic one may be intentional on the OEM's part. My Kubuntu Focus system upgraded from an OEM kernel to a newer generic kernel and worked just fine, and I confirmed with them that this was intentional.
[2024-01-01 18:57] <arraybolt3> So you could always ask your OEM.
[2024-01-01 19:07] <tomreyn> cryptonector: OEM kernels are basically standard ubuntu kernels but with extra patches to support vendor specific hardware which is not (yet?) supported by upstream linux (kernel.org) and the default ubuntu kernel images. if this situation changes later (driver support for all relevant hardware components becomes available on ubuntu kernel images) then it would make sense to have you move away from OEM images and track ubuntu's default kernel
[2024-01-01 19:07] <tomreyn> images.
[2024-01-01 19:10] <JanC> e.g. upgrade to a new HWE kernel
[2024-01-01 19:21] <cryptonector> I see, thanks!
[2024-01-01 19:22] <cryptonector> this is an OEM install that I re-did (by adding all the apt sources, keys, etc) by installing w/ ZFS root
[2024-01-01 19:30] <Guest33> does the latest ubuntu support oem install?
[2024-01-01 19:47] <tomreyn> Guest33: 22.04 LTS does according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ubuntu_OEM_Installer_Overview - I would assume that 23.10 does, too.
[2024-01-01 19:54] <cryptonector> how do I determine what kernel I'm running right now?
[2024-01-01 19:55] <cryptonector> (uname -r)
[2024-01-01 19:55] <cryptonector> also, how do I force my ubuntu back onto the OEM kernerl
[2024-01-01 20:08] <tomreyn> cryptonector: cat /proc/version     may provide more information on the running kernel
[2024-01-01 20:10] <tomreyn> cryptonector: to make the oem kernel the new default, there are multiple approaches. one is to uninstall all kernel images with a higher version. another is to define the default kernel to boot into, using grub tooling.
[2024-01-01 20:21] <Miroboru> I am trying to setup sssd for LDAP authentication. Server is already set up (Synology). First of all - do I need to edit any other files than sssd.conf and nsswitch.conf?
[2024-01-01 20:22] <Miroboru> I cannot get simple ldap commands like ldapwhoami to work without providing the binddn via -D and the password via -w/W, although I have specified all of that in sssd.conf
[2024-01-01 20:23] <oerheks> there is a guide for that, https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-sssd-ldap  and https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-ldap-usage
[2024-01-01 20:23] <Miroboru> In short - I don't think my sssd setup is working at all. I can query the ldap server if I provide bind and base dns
[2024-01-01 20:24] <foo> Hello, I'm in ubuntu desktop right now on an old laptop. It's not booting, keeps dropping me into maintenance mode. My sense if I shut it down improperly and there's some weird hard drive issue. Is there a command I can run to force a filesystem check to fix filesystem things?
[2024-01-01 20:25] <arraybolt3> fsck /dev/sdXY (replacing XY with the drive letter and partition number of the affected partition)
[2024-01-01 20:26] <tomreyn> Miroboru: you *might* have more luck with getting qualified feedback on this during a business week in #ubuntu-server
[2024-01-01 20:26] <arraybolt3> So assuming you need to fix the second partition of the sda disk, "fsck /dev/sda2"
[2024-01-01 20:27] <Miroboru> tomreyn: Thank you. I have follow the documentation that was referee to here, but to no avail. I'll try later in the week then :)
[2024-01-01 20:30] <tomreyn> foo: because you're apparently trying to fix your root file system, you may want to bring up the grub menu, then press 'e' and move tot the end of the "Linux" line and add     fsck.mode=force fsck.repair=yes
[2024-01-01 20:30] <tomreyn> Miroboru: you're welcome, sorry i can't help with sssd myself.
[2024-01-01 20:31] <tomreyn> foo: after adding this, you'd boot this using ctrl-x
[2024-01-01 20:36] <foo> arraybolt3: thank you
[2024-01-01 20:36] <foo> tomreyn: thank you
[2024-01-01 20:39] <tomreyn> foo: you're welcome. yet another option would be to instruct grub to boot to the recovery menu, spawn the root shell and then manually fsck the file system.
[2024-01-01 20:39] <tomreyn> (that's what i'd prefer to do, because that way you can better control what fsck does)
[2024-01-01 20:40] <foo> tomreyn: ah, already did what you said :) We'll see what it does
[2024-01-01 20:42] <tomreyn> i should have said that using fsck.repair=yes is a bit dangerous because an fsck repair *can be* destructive
[2024-01-01 21:02] <foo> tomreyn: it doesn't seem that fixed it, same issue. Will try to reboot again. To be fair, this laptop is getting phased out. If I lost data on here, I think I already had it backed up so likely ok... but would be nice to do a final backup before I phase it out
[2024-01-01 21:19] <foo> tomreyn: I wonder if that "e" gets saved after reboot?
[2024-01-01 21:20] <foo> tomreyn: I rebooted from maintenance and it seems to be stuck at the Ubuntu loading screen. I feel like it's doing a fsck in the background and that's why it's taking so long but I don't know for certain
[2024-01-01 21:34] <tomreyn> foo: you can remove "quiet" and "splash" and try hitting escape now to see if you get more output
[2024-01-01 21:35] <tomreyn> remove, from the linux command line, you're editing in grub
[2024-01-01 21:35] <foo> tomreyn: ok, will do that once this finishes. ESC doesn't seem to be doing anything
[2024-01-01 21:35] <tomreyn> does you see disk access happening though, if there's an indicator LED?
[2024-01-01 21:36] <tomreyn> *do you
[2024-01-01 21:37] <tomreyn> to answer your earlier question: the changes you make by pressing 'e' on the grub menu do not persist a reboot
[2024-01-01 21:57] <foo> tomreyn: I didn't think they existed on reboot. I don't have a drive indicator light. But I do "hear it" like the drive is doing something
[2024-01-01 21:58] <foo> I did remove the "dirty bit" when I did an fsck on /dev/sda2
[2024-01-01 21:58] <foo> I wonder if that helped or hurt things
[2024-01-01 21:59] <tomreyn> you mean you explicitly removed it?
[2024-01-01 21:59] <tomreyn> or was it just a result of running fsck?
[2024-01-01 21:59] <tomreyn> (with --repair)
[2024-01-01 22:01] <foo> tomreyn: huh, I just ran fsck /dev/sda2 I think. It asked if I wanted to remove it. I hit yes. I didn't do a --repair option *facepalm
[2024-01-01 22:01] <tomreyn> i would not recommend removing it if you have reasons to assume the file system remains broken, especially if that may be so due to they physical storage
[2024-01-01 22:01] <tomreyn> if it asked whether you want to remove it then that's fine
[2024-01-01 22:02] <tomreyn> because fsck would only offer that after it realized there does not seem to be corruption
[2024-01-01 22:02] <tomreyn> you should review your system logs for indications of hardware errors / disk access errors, though
[2024-01-01 22:03] <tomreyn> also make sure to back up anything you might still need.
[2024-01-01 22:06] <Miroboru> nvcc
[2024-01-01 22:06] <Miroboru> Oops
[2024-01-01 22:07] <foo> tomreyn: thanks, I'm trying to back stuff up then this laptop is getting trashed.
[2024-01-01 22:08] <foo> I think I may try a --repair option since I didn't do that the first time and shut this down, been stuck on ubuntu screen for an hour
[2024-01-01 22:10] <EriC^^> escape does nothing foo?
[2024-01-01 22:10] <tomreyn> foo: as discussed above, --repair can make things worse. i suggets you first check whether the disk is still ok or has physical errors, preventing a repair from succeeding
[2024-01-01 22:11] <tomreyn> you'd need to do so from either receovery (if you can boot to that) or a live usb stick
[2024-01-01 22:11] <foo> EriC^^: correct
[2024-01-01 22:12] <EriC^^> foo perhaps try sysrq to get to reboot?
[2024-01-01 22:12] <foo> tomreyn: Heck, even if I did a USB Stick, mounted the drive, and copied data off... that could work
[2024-01-01 22:12] <foo> EriC^^: I'd have to get to CLI for that? If ESC does nothing, I could hard shut it down
[2024-01-01 22:12] <tomreyn> right, or you could image the partition and then try repairing the file system on a copy of that, so that you can always go back to the current state if that fails.
[2024-01-01 22:13] <EriC^^> try pressing alt+prntscrn+s...then...u...then...b while holding alt+prntsctn
[2024-01-01 22:13] <EriC^^> first could be worth a shot pressing alt+ctrl+del to get it to reboot normally
[2024-01-01 22:14] <tomreyn> and even ctrl-c beforehand (though that usually does nothing during systemd boot)
[2024-01-01 22:16] <chirpingbird> Hello, I wanted to ask a question about an icon on my dash bar. I am running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. There is a program I installed a year ago and pinned to my dash bar, but I cannot remember if I installed it via a .deb or through snap or some other way, so I wanted to find what executable the icon is pointing to.
[2024-01-01 22:16] <chirpingbird> Is there an easy way to find that information?
[2024-01-01 22:17] <rbox> well just look at whats installed in dpkg and snap
[2024-01-01 22:17] <jeremy31> chirpingbird: Right click on the icon, choose properties?
[2024-01-01 22:18] <tomreyn> chirpingbird: you should be able to find out by reviewing the files in ~/.local/share/applications/ and the lines starting with "Exec" in there
[2024-01-01 22:18] <tomreyn> jeremy31: i don't see that option on gnome-shell, do you?
[2024-01-01 22:19] <chirpingbird> jeremy31: I don't quite have that option on the dash bar unfortunately. There is one, "Show Details," but it just brings me to GNOME Software.
[2024-01-01 22:19] <chirpingbird> tomreyn: I will try to look here again.
[2024-01-01 22:21] <jeremy31> tomreyn: I was using Cinnamon on 20.04
[2024-01-01 22:21] <tomreyn> jeremy31: ah, well, that's different i bet ;)
[2024-01-01 22:22] <tomreyn> chirpingbird: i'm nt sure what you mean. here's a command you can paste into a terminal emulator (such as Gnome's "Terminal") though:    cd ~/.local/share/applications/ && rgrep ^Exec . && cd
[2024-01-01 22:23] <chirpingbird> Ahhh, sorry. What I meant is, I went to the directory in the terminal emulator and ran `grep -rni 'obsidian' *` (Obsidian is the name of the program), although unfortunately I didn't see anything
[2024-01-01 22:25] <EriC^^> chirpingbird: try "dpkg -l | grep obsidian"
[2024-01-01 22:25] <webchat47> I get this error when I try and "allow others to create and delete files in this folder": 'net usershare' returned error 255: [2024/01/01 15:20:59,  0] ../../lib/util/debug.c:1100(reopen_one_log)

[2024-01-01 22:25] <webchat47> I have tried to chmod -R 777 every single folder, etc., and still, via samba, no one can read or write into the shared directories. Can anyone please help?
[2024-01-01 22:25] <tomreyn> chirpingbird: also:   which obsidian; which Obsidian
[2024-01-01 22:28] <chirpingbird> I did get something for dpkg! I see:
[2024-01-01 22:28] <chirpingbird> ```
[2024-01-01 22:28] <chirpingbird> rcÂ  obsidianÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.5.3
[2024-01-01 22:28] <chirpingbird> Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  amd64
[2024-01-01 22:28] <chirpingbird> ```
[2024-01-01 22:28] <chirpingbird> Although nothing for the which commands.
[2024-01-01 22:28] <EriC^^> webchat47: it sounds like it's expecting just a name somewhere and you're giving it "hd/log.." and it doesnt like the "/"
[2024-01-01 22:29] <tomreyn> chirpingbird: the dpkg output says that an "obsidian" deb/ apt package was once installed, but only its configuration files (and possibly other data) remain now.
[2024-01-01 22:29] <EriC^^> chirpingbird: that means it's been removed but the config files are still there
[2024-01-01 22:29] <EriC^^> chirpingbird: when you click on the dash icon does the program still launch?
[2024-01-01 22:30] <chirpingbird> Ahhh, ok, thank you. That's strange
[2024-01-01 22:30] <EriC^^> maybe it's a snap right now, try "snap list | grep obsidian"
[2024-01-01 22:30] <chirpingbird> The program attempts to launch when I click the dash icon, I see a black screen that is the same size of the application that usually pops up; and when I try to click it twice while launching, it also launches a white screent hat is the same size of the window of the application that usually pops up
[2024-01-01 22:31] <EriC^^> aha
[2024-01-01 22:31] <chirpingbird> So what is strange to me is that, it seems to exhibit similar behavior to the installed program
[2024-01-01 22:31] <chirpingbird> Except with bugs
[2024-01-01 22:31] <EriC^^> aha
[2024-01-01 22:32] <chirpingbird> "snap list | grep obsidian" does show empty
[2024-01-01 22:32] <EriC^^> ok
[2024-01-01 22:32] <oerheks> appimage?
[2024-01-01 22:32] <oerheks> https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian
[2024-01-01 22:33] <oerheks> or flatpak
[2024-01-01 22:33] <chirpingbird> I'm guessing there's no spot on the OS where the contents of the pinned dash icons are stored? Maybe I'm just being extra paranoid, I end up thinking that the screens are evidence that it is still installed somewhere
[2024-01-01 22:33] <oerheks> path in that dash launcher might reveal the path to the icon in the program folder
[2024-01-01 22:33] <EriC^^> chirpingbird: if you want try pressing the dash icon, and with it running look at "ps -e exe" it should show the command at the bottom
[2024-01-01 22:36] <tomreyn> chirpingbird: i explained how to find out what the dash icons run a while ago
[2024-01-01 22:37] <chirpingbird> EriC^^: That was a wonderful idea, thank you so much! This gave me much more information to go off of.
[2024-01-01 22:37] <EriC^^> np, what was the command it showed?
[2024-01-01 22:38] <webchat47> EriC^^ How can I share a directory WITHOUT an "/"?
[2024-01-01 22:38] <chirpingbird> It seems to me it was a file located in `/usr/local/share/applications` as `obsidian.desktop`. I checked the file timestamp, and it seems correct at around the time I installed it about a year and a half ago
[2024-01-01 22:38] <EriC^^> aha
[2024-01-01 22:38] <chirpingbird> It does point to an AppImage
[2024-01-01 22:38] <chirpingbird> `/home/chirpingbird/bin/Obsidian-0.15.6.AppImage`
[2024-01-01 22:39] <EriC^^> i guess it's manually installed then
[2024-01-01 22:39] <chirpingbird> So I suppose I must have installed it that way
[2024-01-01 22:39] <chirpingbird> I see, ok
[2024-01-01 22:39] <chirpingbird> Thank you so much! I have the information I needed, this was genuinely very appreciated!!!
[2024-01-01 22:40] <EriC^^> webchat47: no idea, just the error seems that's what it's saying
[2024-01-01 22:40] <EriC^^> no problem chirpingbird
[2024-01-01 22:41] <EriC^^> webchat47: maybe you're supposed to set the directory somewhere and only there the file name?
[2024-01-02 03:04] <jea0p> hi
[2024-01-02 04:18] <eising> Hey. I have an older ubuntu 20.04 vm and I can't figure out which method is used to set up networking on it. /etc/netplan is empty and /etc/network/ has no entries for the ethernet interface. Any suggestions on what to look for?
[2024-01-02 04:20] <rbox> is networkmanager running?
[2024-01-02 04:29] <eising> rbox: yep
[2024-01-02 04:29] <rbox> then its probably in /etc/NetworkManager
[2024-01-02 04:32] <eising> rbox: alright, thanks. Seems we're spoiled for choice when it comes to network configuration :)
[2024-01-02 05:02] <win> hhh
[2024-01-02 05:46] <Takatzu> hola
[2024-01-02 05:46] <Takatzu> alguien disponibler
[2024-01-02 05:51] <k4k0> hola Takatzu
[2024-01-02 07:47] <eising> Isn't it weird to run NetworkManager on a server though? I would suspect a pure netplan/networkd approach to be more stable and easier to maintain (still looking at this ubuntu-20.04 vm)
[2024-01-02 08:01] <ravage> eising: https://ubuntu.com/blog/netplan-configuration-across-desktop-server-cloud-and-iot
[2024-01-02 08:06] <marcopolo1>  Is " apt remove gnome* " the correct way to remove gnome?
[2024-01-02 08:10] <Guest8> I'm seeking help configuring samba. I sthis the right channel to ask in?
[2024-01-02 08:39] <Paris> I was thinking, you know on Android there is the integrated API to create apps easily, that is widgets, buttons, textfields etc, i wonder if they started something like that for Ubuntu or linux in general, but i think it's not the case. That is an official integrated API for easy app dev.
[2024-01-02 08:40] <Paris> cause there is gnome gtk or kde or fltk and others. It's good to have choice, but a standard one in an IDE facilitates and makes things streamlined, for app dev.
[2024-01-02 08:41] <Paris> Or android compatibility, like the linux phones
[2024-01-02 09:15] <Paris> wrong channel, meant for ubuntu-discuss.
[2024-01-02 10:46] <prova> Hi every bodu
[2024-01-02 10:51] <prova> I have some problem with ubuntu 20.04 and Virtual Machines, in particular in configuring bridged network with netplan and wirsh (I use qemu/kvm with Virtual Machine Manager GUI). Last week i was able to configure a bridged network and host and guest, on a single PC, were able to communicate therebetween).
[2024-01-02 10:53] <prova> Unfortuneously, at reboot time, the old configuration for connecting the PC to internet disappeared and I was unable to connect again. After some various operation, three day after, I can not understand why, the configuration for connecting with internet reappeared, and now I am here!
[2024-01-02 10:56] <prova> Now, i'm afraid to redo the same operations for configuring the bridged network, having the fear of loosing my configuration for connecting to internet! Please, somebody can help me in this trouble!?
[2024-01-02 11:26] <supesdupes> What would be the least hectic way to setup a customized {u|l|x|k|}buntu install? I like how debian has the netinst optional, but wasn't that for ubuntu deprecated with 20.04?
[2024-01-02 13:30] <cbreak> supesdupes: I usually just install a minimal system and do the rest via ansible
[2024-01-02 13:31] <ravage> supesdupes: the official way at least for Ubuntu is https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/install/autoinstall
[2024-01-02 14:06] <cristian_c> hi

[2024-01-02 14:07] <cristian_c> calamares on 23.10 does not detect gpt disk
[2024-01-02 14:07] <cristian_c> so I can't install the os if target gpt disk is not detexted
[2024-01-02 14:08] <cristian_c> of course, live system (partitionmanager, fdisk and file manager detect and mount gpt disk and its partitions)
[2024-01-02 14:08] <cristian_c> of course, live system (partitionmanager, fdisk and file manager) detects and mounts gpt disk and its partitions)
[2024-01-02 14:09] <cristian_c> any ideas how to configure calamares to detect gpt?
[2024-01-02 14:09] <cristian_c> *detected
[2024-01-02 14:16] <tomreyn> cristian_c: which ubuntu flavour are you using? ubuntu itself doesn't use calamares, so it might be better to ask on your flavour channel.
[2024-01-02 14:18] <cristian_c> tomreyn, ok
[2024-01-02 14:58] <arkanoid> hello! Jammy running on laptop here. My system fails to resume to gnome desktop after suspend (suspend to ram). When it resumes gnome shell is a black screen, but virtual consoles, networking and peripherals work
[2024-01-02 14:58] <arkanoid> I'm now in this condition. If I do ctrl-alt-f2 screen flickers to black, and that's it
[2024-01-02 14:59] <arkanoid> dmesg doesn't know anything
[2024-01-02 14:59] <lotuspsychje> arkanoid: can you share your dmesg with the volunteers please
[2024-01-02 15:01] <arkanoid> just tried "sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind" I got visual login back, but after username and pass it goes black screen again
[2024-01-02 15:02] <arkanoid> lotuspsychje: let me try
[2024-01-02 15:06] <arkanoid> sorry but I see dmesg contains informations I should delete before sending, it's a long work
[2024-01-02 15:06] <Kangarooo> I have 20.04 with casper-rw persistence file drive. Can i copy it out, make new Ubuntu 22.04 with persistence and then overwrite old casper to have all files in new live persistance? Will that work?
[2024-01-02 15:07] <Kangarooo> USB live with persistance its im asking about
[2024-01-02 15:13] <arkanoid> this is the red line I see with journalctl gnome-session-binary[168422]: GLib-GIO-CRITICAL: g_bus_get_sync: assertion 'error == NULL || *error == NULL' failed
[2024-01-02 15:15] <lotuspsychje> arkanoid: smells like bug #1968907
[2024-01-02 15:16] <arkanoid> and later on gdm3[1990]: GLib: Source ID 148 was not found when attempting to remove it
[2024-01-02 15:21] <arkanoid> lotuspsychje: possibly yes, but there fix seems to be only in 22.10
[2024-01-02 15:21] <lotuspsychje> arkanoid: if daniel says so, its surely be like that yeah
[2024-01-02 15:22] <arkanoid> damn. Will wait april 2024 then :D
[2024-01-02 15:23] <arkanoid> But if it is a gnome bug, I wonder if I can resume my system without rebooting. From virtual console I mean
[2024-01-02 15:27] <arkanoid> even after killing -3 gnome-shell, the problem persists on next rerun
[2024-01-02 15:28] <Yakov> How to Add Custom Shortcut to Ubuntu using script or cfg?
[2024-01-02 15:30] <arkanoid> success! I have to loginctl terminate-session 2 (where 2 is session-id in loginctl session-list)
[2024-01-02 15:31] <arkanoid> this means that systemctl restart systemd-logind does not kill existing sessions
[2024-01-02 15:31] <arkanoid> which is quite confusing
[2024-01-02 15:33] <arkanoid> also it means that gnome-shell --replace doesn't replace existing session, which is even more confusing
[2024-01-02 15:34] <derek-shnosh> In Ubuntu 23.10, some apps are not honoring the "dark theme" for parts of the window, primarily the menu bar... https://i.imgur.com/M9xH5FM.png

[2024-01-02 16:20] <Menzador> Yakov: What are you trying to accomplish with this?
[2024-01-02 16:25] <leftyfb> Yakov: that is correct but only 1/3 the command. But also, I have double quotes for "script_name"
[2024-01-02 16:25] <Yakov> https://justpaste.it/5c8mz it works but overwrites previous custom_bind_number with new one
[2024-01-02 16:25] <Yakov> hey lefty! Happy New Year, happy new year to all
[2024-01-02 16:41] <derek-shnosh> ioria: saw your response in logs, thanks for looking.
[2024-01-02 16:43] <derek-shnosh> Wonder if its something to do with Wayland.
[2024-01-02 17:03] <derek-shnosh> ioria: Figured it out... `/org/gnome/desktop/interface/gtk-theme` set to "Yaru-blue" previously, adjusted to "Yaru-blue-dark". This setting also found in Tweaks under Appearance > Themes: Legacy Applications

[2024-01-02 17:48] <derek-shnosh> Ok, new one... Ubuntu 23.10, Gnome 45.1, Wayland. I have google-fu'd my way through changing the "ubuntu-logo.png" for the login screen, but articles I'm finding on how to change it on the boot screen are not working. This was one of the more concise links: https://medium.com/@RithvikRThampy/how-to-change-the-ubuntu-22-04-logo-icon-on-the-boot-screen-and-the-login-in-page-49042dc4d490
[2024-01-02 18:00] <arraybolt3> The boot screen is provided by Plymouth fwiw. I'm not sure how hard it is to change.
[2024-01-02 18:00] <arraybolt3> oh, looks like the tutorial you found may do the trick
[2024-01-02 18:06] <Yakov> can you pls help with gsettings custom keybindings?
[2024-01-02 18:07] <leftyfb> Yakov: you're going to have to be more specific than that
[2024-01-02 18:08] <Yakov> Can you pls scroll up a little, I've asked it 1-2 hours ago, you must have seen it
[2024-01-02 18:08] <leftyfb> Yakov: and I answered you
[2024-01-02 18:08] <Yakov> I did not see it :)
[2024-01-02 18:08] <Yakov> and cant see it now too
[2024-01-02 18:08] <leftyfb> Yakov: that is correct but only 1/3 the command. But also, I have double quotes for "script_name"
[2024-01-02 18:09] <Yakov> then I sent https://justpaste.it/5c8mz
[2024-01-02 18:10] <leftyfb> so what is your question then?
[2024-01-02 18:11] <Yakov> when you get commands, you see only last command you just set, so if I set new_command with same lines, I could not see previous
[2024-01-02 18:11] <Yakov> why?
[2024-01-02 18:13] <leftyfb> sorry, I don't follow
[2024-01-02 18:17] <Yakov> https://justpaste.it/5c8mz
[2024-01-02 18:20] <leftyfb> Yakov: gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings "['/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/', '/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom1/','/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom2/']"
[2024-01-02 18:23] <Yakov> understood
[2024-01-02 18:23] <Yakov> thanks :)
[2024-01-02 18:24] <Yakov> same as favorites tab, right?
[2024-01-02 18:24] <leftyfb> yep
[2024-01-02 18:24] <Yakov> I owe you dinner :)
[2024-01-02 18:24] <leftyfb> if you're referring to favorites-apps
[2024-01-02 18:25] <Yakov> right

[2024-01-02 18:29] <leftyfb> alcosta: which hypervisor?
[2024-01-02 18:30] <alcosta> qemu/KVM with Virtual Machine Manager GUI!
[2024-01-02 18:30] <leftyfb> I would typically just create my own bridge in netplan
[2024-01-02 18:30] <alcosta> I have some problem with ubuntu 20.04 and Virtual Machines, in particular in configuring bridged network with netplan and wirsh (I use qemu/kvm with Virtual Machine Manager GUI). Last week i was able to configure a bridged network and host and guest, on a single PC, were able to communicate therebetween).
[2024-01-02 18:31] <Yakov> I just installed sublime from source in Ubuntu, but there is no preferences. How to fix it?
[2024-01-02 18:31] <alcosta> Unfortuneously, at reboot time, the old configuration for connecting the PC to internet disappeared and I was unable to connect again. After some various operation, three day after, I can not understand why, the configuration for connecting with internet reappeared, and now I am here!
[2024-01-02 18:31] <alcosta> Now, i'm afraid to redo the same operations for configuring the bridged network, having the fear of loosing my configuration for connecting to internet! Please, somebody can help me in this trouble!?
[2024-01-02 18:32] <leftyfb> Yakov: you'll have to seek support from the 3rd party vendor for that
[2024-01-02 18:32] <Yakov> ^got it
[2024-01-02 18:33] <leftyfb> alcosta: you should provide(pastebin) netplan configs for the host and the guests
[2024-01-02 18:36] <alcosta> My original 01-network-manager-all.yaml has the following line: # Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system network:   version: 2   renderer: NetworkManager
[2024-01-02 18:36] <leftyfb> so this is a desktop
[2024-01-02 18:37] <leftyfb> where you're using network manager and not netplan
[2024-01-02 18:37] <leftyfb> so the question involves network manager configs
[2024-01-02 18:37] <alcosta> I have a desktop!
[2024-01-02 18:37] <alcosta> I have ubuntu 20.04 desktop (not server).
[2024-01-02 18:37] <leftyfb> my guess would be it's a new profile. A change of the network interface or a new user or something
[2024-01-02 18:39] <alcosta> I can give you the new profile, I changed the previous file with the following file:
[2024-01-02 18:39] <alcosta> # Let NetworkManager manage all devices on this system network:   version: 2   renderer: networkd   ethernets:     enp4s0:       dhcp4: no   bridges:     br0:       interfaces: [ enp4s0 ]       dhcp4: no       addresses: [192.168.2.15/24]       gateway4: 192.168.2.1       nameservers:         addresses: [1.1.1.1]       dhcp6: no       link-local: [ ]       parameters:         stp: true         fo

[2024-01-02 18:43] <alcosta> leftyfb, have you saw the link?
[2024-01-02 18:45] <alcosta> is some body here?
[2024-01-02 18:46] <leftyfb> alcosta: is something currently broken? You really don't need STP for a VM bridge. And why are you setting forward-delay?
[2024-01-02 18:46] <ein44> hello, I have a question about ubuntu pro and how updates work to universe now
[2024-01-02 18:46] <leftyfb> !pro | ein44
[2024-01-02 18:46] <ubottu> ein44: Ubuntu Pro is a service offered by Canonical for expanded CVE patching, ten-years security maintenance and optional support. Anyone can use Ubuntu Pro for free for personal use on up to 5 machines. For details please see https://ubuntu.com/pro and https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-pro-faq
[2024-01-02 18:46] <ein44> so you need to have pro to get universe package updates?
[2024-01-02 18:47] <leftyfb> no
[2024-01-02 18:47] <alcosta> My actual 01-network-manager-all.yaml is as follow: https://dpaste.com/5UT4EZQQB
[2024-01-02 18:47] <leftyfb> ein44: please read the link above
[2024-01-02 18:47] <leftyfb> alcosta: then network manager is managing your network configs
[2024-01-02 18:47] <ein44> thanks leftyfb, so how does this work now? is there some info published about it?
[2024-01-02 18:48] <alcosta> I'm absolute beginner with netplan configuration or other network configuration!
[2024-01-02 18:48] <leftyfb> !pro | ein44

[2024-01-02 18:49] <alcosta> I just desire to have a virtual machine VMA on a PC A and another Virtual Machine VMB on a PC B that communicate all together therebetween!
[2024-01-02 18:50] <leftyfb> alcosta: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-add-network-bridge-with-nmcli-networkmanager-on-linux/
[2024-01-02 18:51] <ein44> leftyfb, thanks. I read the faq there, but one thing isn't clear, how are things handled when there is an update from canonical as well as an update from the community?
[2024-01-02 18:52] <leftyfb> ein44: if you don't have pro enabled, you get the update from the universe repo as norma
[2024-01-02 18:52] <leftyfb> normal*
[2024-01-02 18:54] <alcosta> I found that constructions about configuring netplan somewhere, i don't remember now where!
[2024-01-02 18:56] <alcosta> I saw many internet pages! My big fear is that, when i returned to the iroginal .yaml file, I was not able to reconnect to internet.
[2024-01-02 18:56] <leftyfb> alcosta: you're not currently using netplan to configure networking, you're using Network Manager which is default on Ubuntu desktop. You should stick with that. I just provided instructions for you on how to create a network bridge specifically focused on being used with KVM
[2024-01-02 18:57] <alcosta> My original configuration on - setting - network - .... disappeared! I had it no moreAfter reboot to!!
[2024-01-02 18:57] <leftyfb> alcosta: stick with network manager
[2024-01-02 18:59] <alcosta> I changed the yaml file and some xml file!
[2024-01-02 18:59] <leftyfb> don't
[2024-01-02 18:59] <leftyfb> leave it the default and use network manager
[2024-01-02 18:59] <alcosta> I was NOT able to return to my original connection to internet!
[2024-01-02 19:00] <leftyfb> alcosta: how many files are in /etc/netplan/ ?
[2024-01-02 19:00] <alcosta> I make some confusion: How can i return to use networl manager?
[2024-01-02 19:00] <leftyfb> alcosta: how many files are in /etc/netplan/ ?
[2024-01-02 19:03] <alcosta> Just a moment, pls!
[2024-01-02 19:04] <alcosta> https://imgur.com/a/s89TunV
[2024-01-02 19:04] <leftyfb> alcosta: what does the first one look like?
[2024-01-02 19:06] <alcosta> The first one is equal to the original (i.e. the last one)!
[2024-01-02 19:06] <alcosta> https://dpaste.com/5UT4EZQQB
[2024-01-02 19:07] <leftyfb> alcosta: delete the rest of the files
[2024-01-02 19:07] <leftyfb> then follow https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-add-network-bridge-with-nmcli-networkmanager-on-linux/ to create a network bridge in network manager
[2024-01-02 19:07] <leftyfb> alcosta: there's no need to mess with netplan on this machine anymore
[2024-01-02 19:07] <alcosta> They are not working, they have a file type of no meaning!
[2024-01-02 19:07] <leftyfb> delete them
[2024-01-02 19:08] <leftyfb> or move them somewhere else
[2024-01-02 19:10] <alcosta> Just a moment, pls!
[2024-01-02 19:11] <leftyfb> alcosta: delete or relocate those files, then follow https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-add-network-bridge-with-nmcli-networkmanager-on-linux/ to create a network bridge in network manager. That should give you what you need
[2024-01-02 19:12] <alcosta> Deleted!
[2024-01-02 19:13] <alcosta> I'll take some time to read the page you gave me! See you later, in the next hours! Thank you, leftyfb!
[2024-01-02 20:41] <Guest24> hello
[2024-01-02 20:42] <Guest24> just need now if example if I go  settings/network/wired shows 100mbs does this mean my network driver will not connect higher speed lets says 400mbs
[2024-01-02 20:42] <Guest24> my network driver supports 1000mbs so is this driver issue
[2024-01-02 20:43] <mybalzitch> could be cable or switch issue. 400mbps isn't a standard just fyi. Some drivers don't autonegotiate properly so you have to force it to 1000 mbps / full duplex
[2024-01-02 20:43] <leftyfb> Guest24: it could be a cabling issue or issue on the other end of the cable (switch, router, hub)
[2024-01-02 20:43] <leftyfb> these daysm it's less likely to be a driver issue
[2024-01-02 20:44] <Guest24> ok
[2024-01-02 20:50] <Guest24> ok
[2024-01-02 20:53] <Guest24> I'm currently speed about 80 mbs that makes no difference  the settings/network/wired will show always 1000mbs if network drivers support it
[2024-01-02 20:53] <Guest24> i this correct
[2024-01-02 20:53] <Guest24> is
[2024-01-02 20:55] <tomreyn> Guest24: the speed showing in settings/network/wired is what both ends of the connection have agreed on to be the physical line speed.
[2024-01-02 20:59] <tomreyn> i.e. the 'link speed'
[2024-01-02 20:59] <Guest24> 80mbs
[2024-01-02 21:05] <tomreyn> Guest24: so the link speed is more of a theoretical maximum speed, it does not guarantee that data can actually be transmitted over this link at this speed (in fact it will almost always be *at least* a fraction less)
[2024-01-02 21:07] <Guest24> ok last time the settings/network/wired shows 100mbs and my current speed is 80mbs if change speed 500mbs it will show settings/network/wired 1000mbs
[2024-01-02 21:07] <tomreyn> if your measured transfer speed over this link is much slower, which "80mbs" might mean, if this means mega*bits* per second, then you should also check whether the endpoints of the connection are exactly identical, or whether there are other links and intermediate devices on this connection where you're measuring throughput.
[2024-01-02 21:12] <Guest24> ok
[2024-01-02 21:29] <yohan> klk
[2024-01-02 21:33] <en1gma> "ctrl-a" does not copy all in terminal but works in firefox. why?
[2024-01-02 21:34] <en1gma> im on ubuntu 22.04.3 lts amd64-desktop (all updates as of today).
[2024-01-02 21:35] <pragmaticenigma> "ctrl + a" doesn't copy anything, it's a select all keyboard shortcut. The terminal emulator program you are using doesn't support that keyboard command.
[2024-01-02 21:37] <bprompt> en1gma: as mentioned above by pragmaticenigma , depends on the terminal app you're using, some have more options than others, I use Konsole, has lots of options
[2024-01-02 21:37] <en1gma> yes i mean why does ctrl-a select all in the default ubuntu terminal
[2024-01-02 21:38] <en1gma> does'nt &
[2024-01-02 21:38] <en1gma> omg doesnt *
[2024-01-02 21:38] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: you would have to ask the developer of the program. It was a design decision on their part
[2024-01-02 21:39] <en1gma> i was reading on net that /etc/bash.bashrc needs edited. just came here to make sure that is correct
[2024-01-02 21:39] <en1gma> it uses emacs setup or vi by default for terminal
[2024-01-02 21:40] <en1gma> just wanted to verify that is the problem (with at least me).
[2024-01-02 21:40] <en1gma> maybe there is a different key for select all in terminal. i will check that first
[2024-01-02 21:41] <pragmaticenigma> I wouldn't edit that file en1gma ... good way to break your system. If you want to test something, create a second account on the machine and edit that user's bashrc file
[2024-01-02 21:41] <en1gma> from what i found on the net they said that is the problem and dont describe what to edit... dang. looking for different keyboard shortcut first
[2024-01-02 21:44] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: honestly, for copy|paste being contextually aware is an important feature. There is no divisions in terminal that would provide such context and therefore you would be getting a giant history of everything that transpired. If you are trying to capture text generated by running a program you should redirect the output to a file such as "top > ~/top_output.txt" Which would redirect the output of top, to a file in the user directory
[2024-01-02 21:44] <pragmaticenigma> called top_output.txt
[2024-01-02 21:44] <pragmaticenigma> (that is a very poor example, as top runs in a loop, just an FYI)
[2024-01-02 21:45] <en1gma> when i open a new terminal and run build commands for kernels and it has a long history of output it would be nice to select all
[2024-01-02 21:45] <en1gma> instead of click primary mouse button and keep scooting mouse all the way to top
[2024-01-02 21:46] <en1gma> i want to copy all the output from my 'make defconfig && make' commands
[2024-01-02 21:47] <en1gma> its a new terminal
[2024-01-02 21:47] <pragmaticenigma> okay, this is just a farce... best of luck to you
[2024-01-02 21:47] <en1gma> i dont mind 'clear -T' or 'clear -t' either
[2024-01-02 21:47] <en1gma> farce? its lefit
[2024-01-02 21:47] <en1gma> legit*
[2024-01-02 21:48] <armadefuego> well your screen buffer is, likely, longer than the output of the command.
[2024-01-02 21:48] <en1gma> i think so because i think it works sometime when not as much scroll back
[2024-01-02 21:49] <en1gma> i have unlimited scroll back in terminal options (or similar setting) forget exact name
[2024-01-02 21:49] <en1gma> but like i said i can do 'clear -t' or whatever to clear it before i start my make commands
[2024-01-02 21:50] <en1gma> i dont mind that.
[2024-01-02 21:50] <armadefuego> the _all_ can get a _lot_
[2024-01-02 21:50] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: The terminal has a limited history/buffer. If you want to capture the output from make, you would use `make defconfig > ~/make_output.txt 2>&` which would take all output and dump it to the file.
[2024-01-02 21:51] <en1gma> ok. guess i can do that. thanks for the command. just so used to ctrl-a for select all. dang
[2024-01-02 21:51] <armadefuego> and you can still scrape 1000 lines of output.
[2024-01-02 21:51] <armadefuego> Just start selecting at the start of the command
[2024-01-02 21:51] <en1gma> ahhh. let me try that. 1 sec
[2024-01-02 21:52] <armadefuego> y
[2024-01-02 21:52] <armadefuego> joe@systemserver:~$ yes | head -2000
[2024-01-02 21:52] <armadefuego> y
[2024-01-02 21:52] <armadefuego> ( i could have scrapped more, but that would be spam!
[2024-01-02 21:54] <en1gma> ill just use mouse primary and keep moving it up and wear out my mouse pad feet :)
[2024-01-02 21:55] <en1gma> i think its easier and it does work ok and i get to keep my terminal output in the terminal window
[2024-01-02 21:55] <en1gma> maybe i will install konsole and get used to that. i always just liked terminal though
[2024-01-02 21:56] <en1gma> i think i will look into the /etc/bash.bashrc file too.
[2024-01-02 21:56] <en1gma> i can always change it back if i back it up
[2024-01-02 21:56] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: please don't... that will potentially break your system. And no... you will have a very difficult time getting to that file
[2024-01-02 21:57] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: if you edit anything edit ~/.bashrc
[2024-01-02 21:57] <en1gma> ok. ok i wont do that. i will gladly accept that advice if its that important
[2024-01-02 21:57] <en1gma> ok cool.
[2024-01-02 21:57] <pragmaticenigma> that is read after the one in /etc and is used to override settings and configurations found in the /etc location.
[2024-01-02 21:58] <en1gma> i think i have edited that ~/.bashrc before.
[2024-01-02 21:58] <en1gma> not on this install (yet)
[2024-01-02 21:58] <pragmaticenigma> editing ~/.bashrc is safer, and won't get clobbered if Ubuntu sends out an update/patch for the system level one
[2024-01-02 21:59] <armadefuego> yes. personal preferences should go in the personal file.
[2024-01-02 21:59] <armadefuego> system wide ones should be _well known to not effect the system_
[2024-01-02 22:11] <en1gma> yep yep. ok thanks. will try after i get this build out of the way. still doing some work at the moment.

[2024-01-03 00:08] <en1gma> i need to "compress with 7zip zstd copy mode". how do i do this in ubuntu 22.04.3 lts? i have 7zip installed but when i do '7zz i' i dont see "zstd"
[2024-01-03 00:08] <en1gma> is there another supported package that will do the same?
[2024-01-03 00:14] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: zstd is available as a standalone package
[2024-01-03 00:14] <teletubby> does anyone play gmod here?
[2024-01-03 00:14] <teletubby> asking for a reaso
[2024-01-03 00:14] <teletubby> reason*
[2024-01-03 00:14] <pragmaticenigma> teletubby: That's not a support topic, please ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
[2024-01-03 00:17] <teletubby> okay
[2024-01-03 00:21] <en1gma> pragmaticenigma yea i got that installed but my research on net keeps showing it being used for ubuntu install or deb pkg. im looking the help file now
[2024-01-03 00:26] <pragmaticenigma> en1gma: I know that 7zip has additional codecs to install, but I have no idea how to get those installed. nor do I understand what "copy mode" means
[2024-01-03 00:29] <en1gma> pragmaticenigma i was just looking on how to install those libs/codecs also. im just going to boot to windows and zip there with zstd and come back. shouldnt take but a minute. 7zip needs to release it for linux people in a package instead of windows binary.

[2024-01-03 01:48] <z1nt3k> Hello there
[2024-01-03 02:48] <alcosta> Hi everybody! Is leftyfb here?
[2024-01-03 02:51] <alcosta> Some hours ago I talked with leftyfb about configuration of bridged network on ubuntu 20.04 via nmcli and Network Manager.
[2024-01-03 02:52] <alcosta> I don't see leftyfb now here! Can somebody other give me some suggestions?
[2024-01-03 02:54] <sarnold> it'd help if you said what you're trying to accomplish, what you tried, what it did, what you expected, etc
[2024-01-03 02:56] <alcosta> Hi sarnold! I have two PC (A, B) connected via a switch device. On each computer I have a Virtual Machine (VMA, VMB). I want all the machines can communicate therebetween!
[2024-01-03 02:57] <alcosta> All the machines run ubuntu 20.04.
[2024-01-03 02:58] <alcosta> leftyfb suggested me to follow what is said in https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-add-network-bridge-with-nmcli-networkmanager-on-linux/
[2024-01-03 02:58] <sarnold> I think the usual approach for this one is to create a new bridge in libvirt for the VMs, add the physical NICs to the bridge, and then (the tricky part) set the IP address for "the machine" ON THE BRIDGE and not on the interface
[2024-01-03 02:59] <leftyfb> sarnold: they should only need a network bridge
[2024-01-03 02:59] <alcosta> I tried to follow what is said inside that page but... something is not right!
[2024-01-03 02:59] <sarnold> heya leftyfb :)
[2024-01-03 02:59] <leftyfb> alcosta: please use pastebin to paste what is wrong
[2024-01-03 03:00] <alcosta> Hi leftyfb! :)
[2024-01-03 03:02] <alcosta> https://dpaste.com/7UT38Q35N
[2024-01-03 03:03] <alcosta> The command there are not exactly corresponding with my case!
[2024-01-03 03:04] <leftyfb> it looks like you did lots of bad things
[2024-01-03 03:04] <leftyfb> open up your network manager GUI and delete all the bridge* interfaces you created
[2024-01-03 03:04] <alcosta> May be have some device not exactly needed! Maybe nm-bridge  make a mess!
[2024-01-03 03:04] <leftyfb> start over
[2024-01-03 03:06] <alcosta> How can I send you an image, I don't remember the address! Pls, can you suggest me the addr?
[2024-01-03 03:07] <leftyfb> alcosta: in particular, I don't know how you managed to create 3 separate bridges called "bridge", "bridge-br0" and "bridge-slave-eno1"
[2024-01-03 03:07] <leftyfb> !imgur
[2024-01-03 03:07] <leftyfb> alcosta: imgur.com
[2024-01-03 03:08] <leftyfb> alcosta: it looks like you maybe skimmed the instructions, didn't really pay attention to any of the explanations and instead just copy and pasted some things in your terminal and kept trying a bunch of invalid iterations on your initial invalid command(s)
[2024-01-03 03:08] <alcosta> From NM I have this: https://imgur.com/a/pK1DT1G
[2024-01-03 03:09] <alcosta> How can I delete all the unnecessary interface/device?
[2024-01-03 03:11] <leftyfb> alcosta: please run this and paste the resulting URL here:   ( nmcli con delete 1063727f-db41-4ef9-a24b-58870ef94604 && nmcli con delete 272c156d-612c-4230-aa92-4b0107d68cde && nmcli con delete 81f27aab-ad43-4f1b-97b0-03dbd4634ac8 ) | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-03 03:11] <alcosta> Maybe nm-bridge is at the origin of all the issues! I don't know how and why it is there! I gave the instruction as it is said in the page, but the result is a bit different!
[2024-01-03 03:12] <leftyfb> alcosta: please run this and paste the resulting URL here:   ( nmcli con delete 1063727f-db41-4ef9-a24b-58870ef94604 && nmcli con delete 272c156d-612c-4230-aa92-4b0107d68cde && nmcli con delete 81f27aab-ad43-4f1b-97b0-03dbd4634ac8 && nmcli con show) | nc termbin.com 9999

[2024-01-03 03:18] <leftyfb> ^ run this in a terminal in it's entirety
[2024-01-03 03:18] <leftyfb> it will result in a termbin.com URL which you can paste here
[2024-01-03 03:18] <alcosta> https://termbin.com/9xdt
[2024-01-03 03:19] <leftyfb> ok, now you should have an interface called br0
[2024-01-03 03:20] <alcosta> OK!
[2024-01-03 03:20] <leftyfb> reboot your machine. Once it boots, you can run "ip -c a"  and it should sho that br0 has an ip address
[2024-01-03 03:22] <alcosta> Ok! I'll reboot! I hope I can see you soon! :)

[2024-01-03 03:41] <leftyfb> alcosta: once you have br0 with an ip address, you can follow this to get the bridge setup in VM's you create with https://www.tecmint.com/create-network-bridge-in-ubuntu/#:~:text=Using%20a%20Network%20Bridge%20in%20KVM
[2024-01-03 03:42] <leftyfb> alcosta: yes, follow that to create a bridge using nm-connection-editor like I told you
[2024-01-03 03:42] <leftyfb> sorry, I said manager, meant to say editor
[2024-01-03 03:42] <alcosta> Ok! :)
[2024-01-03 03:43] <leftyfb> alcosta: also, you might get better help in #libvirt for this sort of thing
[2024-01-03 03:43] <leftyfb> I'm not that well versed in libvirt/KVM
[2024-01-03 03:43] <leftyfb> but it's not very difficult
[2024-01-03 03:43] <leftyfb> you really should be spending time trying to understand how this all works. That will help you out more than anything
[2024-01-03 03:50] <alcosta> Something isn't good!? https://imgur.com/a/Ove4emt
[2024-01-03 03:52] <alcosta> Under ethernet, there is no bridge-br0!
[2024-01-03 04:02] <alcosta> Ok leftyfb! I'll do some tests! You can go to bed now! We can hear tomorrow afternnon (here about 16:00, 10:00 by you)! Ok!?

[2024-01-03 13:19] <ELFrederich> 7 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them. ... how do I upgrade them without copy/pasting each one into and apt upgrade command?  `apt upgrade -y` doesn't do it, they're kept back.  Same with `apt dist-upgrade`
[2024-01-03 13:20] <lotuspsychje> !phasedupdates | ELFrederich
[2024-01-03 13:20] <ubottu> ELFrederich: Since Ubuntu 21.04, APT may hold back some updates on some systems while they are being phased in. This is called "phased updates". See https://ubottu.com/y/phased and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PhasedUpdates for more info.
[2024-01-03 13:21] <pragmaticenigma> ELFrederich: Also, without you posting the full output of `apt upgrade` there is no way for us to know why something is being held back. Copy the output of `apt upgrad` to https://dpaste.com so we can see what's going on.
[2024-01-03 13:22] <ELFrederich> so they're like a slow roll out?... meaning some increasing percentage of people will get them until it's 100%?
[2024-01-03 13:22] <pragmaticenigma> ELFrederich: There's no way to really know what's going on until you post the output of `apt upgrade`
[2024-01-03 13:23] <ELFrederich> pragmaticenigma, https://dpaste.com/DL77MNLX7
[2024-01-03 13:24] <ELFrederich> FWIW, chat gpt said to try `apt dist-upgrade` and `apt full-upgrade`, neither of which worked.
[2024-01-03 13:25] <pragmaticenigma> that looks more like a package dependency conflict. and please understand ChatGPT is confidently wrong, it's basing the information on unknown sources that are likely out of date, since its model is based on data pre-2018
[2024-01-03 13:25] <ELFrederich> yeah... I'll count this as the 3rd time I've used ChatGPT.  So far it's been good 1 out of 3 times ;-)
[2024-01-03 13:27] <pragmaticenigma> It's a tool, and like any other tool, one must learn to use it before one an trust it.
[2024-01-03 13:28] <ELFrederich> pragmaticenigma, on another 20.04 VM where I have hardly anything installed I have 5 packages being kept back... one moment, pasting to dpaste
[2024-01-03 13:29] <ELFrederich> https://dpaste.com/AMFLPN7QJ
[2024-01-03 13:30] <ELFrederich> this is on WSL installed though a rootfs download (ubuntu-jammy-wsl-amd64-wsl.rootfs.tar.gz)
[2024-01-03 13:33] <pragmaticenigma> ELFrederich: I'm getting the same held back message on one of my machines. I would just be patient and wait a week before I'd be concerned. Those packages are not-critical to the operation of the computer
[2024-01-03 13:34] <pragmaticenigma> !info distro-info

[2024-01-03 13:35] <_ELFrederich> pragmaticenigma, ... my network dropped.
[2024-01-03 13:36] <_ELFrederich> last I saw was the !info distro-info
[2024-01-03 13:36] <pragmaticenigma> !info distro-info | ELFrederich
[2024-01-03 13:36] <ubottu> ELFrederich: distro-info (1.5ubuntu0.23.10.1, mantic): provides information about the distributions' releases. In component main, is important. Built by distro-info. Size 19 kB / 66 kB
[2024-01-03 13:37] <pragmaticenigma> those packages that are being held back are just information generating tools.
[2024-01-03 13:42] <pragmaticenigma> ELFrederich: If you're willing to expirement, you can try `apt-get --with-new-pkgs upgrade` or try manually installing each of the listed packages. Your milage may vary.
[2024-01-03 14:50] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-03 15:02] <alcosta> leftyfb, are you there?
[2024-01-03 15:05] <alcosta> leftyfb, I am tired. I don't understand anything more! I'm going to bed! See you later!
[2024-01-03 16:11] <coz_> Ubuntu MATE supported here?
[2024-01-03 16:11] <arraybolt3> Yes.
[2024-01-03 16:11] <lotuspsychje> it is coz_
[2024-01-03 16:11] <lotuspsychje> official ubuntu !flavour
[2024-01-03 16:11] <coz_> lotuspsychje, hey high %)
[2024-01-03 16:12] <coz_> OK!  I tried ubuntu mate but was disappointed that compiz did not have the "experimental"  plugins. Are they available somewhere?
[2024-01-03 16:15] <coz_> I would like to install this on another laptop, however, if no experimental plugins for compiz are avialable will make me go elsewhere
[2024-01-03 16:16] <oerheks> IIRC one should build them from source?
[2024-01-03 16:16] <coz_> mmmm ok
[2024-01-03 16:17] <pragmaticenigma> They are available through a 3rd party PPA, however those are at your own risk and support isn't available here
[2024-01-03 16:18] <coz_> pragmaticenigma, Last I remember, they were upgraded from exxperimental. Don't recall new title
[2024-01-03 16:19] <coz_> they run exceptionally on other distros but wanted Ubuntu"again" for the family laptop
[2024-01-03 16:20] <pragmaticenigma> coz_: You can try installing these packages and see if they provide what you want. I have no idea if they exist in the default package repositories: compiz compiz-plugins compizconfig-settings-manager fusion-icon compiz-plugins-extra emerald
[2024-01-03 16:20] <coz_> pragmaticenigma, they are not in the repos
[2024-01-03 16:21] <coz_> thanks pragmaticenigma
[2024-01-03 16:21] <pragmaticenigma> I would live with what you have. All instructions I'm finding are from 2016 and older. Would not recommend following any of them, as version compatiblity is going to be a major issue.
[2024-01-03 16:22] <coz_> pragmaticenigma, understood, the another distro it is :(
[2024-01-03 16:26] <pragmaticenigma> coz_: FWIW some of those effects are starting to be added into newer versions of Gnome Desktop. I don't know what the timeline is, or if they will be added to Ubuntu Desktop, but I encourage you to keep a look out for it.
[2024-01-03 16:27] <coz_> pragmaticenigma, yeah wayfire, I know, Ido the icons for the prokect,however I truly hate gnome :)
[2024-01-03 16:27] <coz_> prokect =  project
[2024-01-03 16:28] <pragmaticenigma> coz_: You do know that MATE is based on Gnome 2.x?
[2024-01-03 16:28] <coz_> pragmaticenigma, I meant current state of gnome not gnome 2
[2024-01-03 16:28] <pragmaticenigma> helps to be specific
[2024-01-03 16:29] <coz_> pragmaticenigma, you are absolutely correct, my bad
[2024-01-03 16:35] <cahoots> hi, i have a very messed up boot setup, and my machine won't boot at all. it has an ubuntu partition that i want to boot to, but currently when i start up, it just takes me straight to bios settings (unless i have my gparted usb plugged in). how can i repair this
[2024-01-03 17:01] <EriC^^> cahoots: can you share 'sudo parted -ls | nc termbin.com 9999' ?
[2024-01-03 17:19] <cahoots> EriC^^, i ended up installing a usb with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair , and tried auto-repair, but still no dice. here's the summary it gave: sprunge.us/1GRtrd
[2024-01-03 17:20] <cahoots> i see stuff in there i don't use anymore, like OpenCore
[2024-01-03 17:21] <cahoots> and here's the contents of that parted command you mentioned: https://termbin.com/6kvy1
[2024-01-03 17:22] <cahoots> oh oops, that sprunge link is wrong. here's the correct one: sprunge.us/2GRtrd
[2024-01-03 17:33] <EriC^^> cahoots: everything looks good, in which mode are you booting the pc up? uefi? csm legacy?
[2024-01-03 18:52] <cahoots> EriC^^, so i ended up clearing and recreating my bios_grub and boot,esp partitions. i then ran the boot repair tool, reinstalling grub as well, and got the following summary: http://sprunge.us/jXCYb5 . next, it says, "please do not forget to make your uefi firmare boot on the Ubuntu 22.04.3 lts entry (nvme0n1p2/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file)!", so i ran `sudo efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/nvme0n1 --part 2
[2024-01-03 18:52] <cahoots> --loader /efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi --label "Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"`. then i hit enter and it said, "GRUB still absent"
[2024-01-03 18:57] <Urk> Is there a desktop version of whatsapp in the repos?
[2024-01-03 18:58] <leftyfb> Urk: sudo snap install whatsapp-app
[2024-01-03 18:58] <leftyfb> there's also whatsapp-for-linux and whatsapp-4linux
[2024-01-03 18:58] <leftyfb> I don't know the difference between any of them. You'll have to try them
[2024-01-03 18:58] <Urk> thanks
[2024-01-03 19:00] <Urk> What do I do now that it is downloaded with snap?
[2024-01-03 19:01] <leftyfb> run it
[2024-01-03 19:02] <leftyfb> Urk: actually, going by the last time these were updated, I would use https://snapcraft.io/whatsapp-for-linux
[2024-01-03 19:03] <Urk> leftyfb:  I just did that too
[2024-01-03 19:03] <Urk> https://snapcraft.io/whatsapp-for-linux
[2024-01-03 19:04] <Urk> but how do you access it after it is installed?
[2024-01-03 19:05] <leftyfb> Urk: you open it the same way you open every other app installed on ubuntu
[2024-01-03 19:05] <Urk> I just found an app on my laptop for it
[2024-01-03 19:07] <Urk> Whatsapp for linux won't work on my computer, but the one you first provided did open up, and now prompting me to link my phone with a QR code.
[2024-01-03 19:07] <oerheks> yes, you need a phone for that first
[2024-01-03 19:40] <EriC^^> cahoots: everything looks good, in which mode are you booting the pc up? uefi? csm legacy?
[2024-01-03 19:41] <EriC^^> in the bios settings under boot options it should say
[2024-01-03 19:42] <EriC^^> also ther might be a run-time boot menu you can access with a key according to your pc make which might shed some light on the situation more
[2024-01-03 19:43] <Menzador> Urk: That specific app is just a wrapper for what's known as the Electron web application framework. Applications using it are designed to work the same way that it would work on the web app. So for WhatsApp what you described was normal behavior; it just requires you authenticate through your phone (not unlike Steam Guard and Discord's phone-based authentication)
[2024-01-03 19:43] <Urk> Menzador:  I was able to get it to work, and using it now.
[2024-01-03 19:46] <Menzador> Perfect! :)
[2024-01-03 20:04] <m__> hi .. i am new to linux and stuff where on the internet can i be well versed with irssi?
[2024-01-03 20:04] <cahoots> EriC^^, i'm in eufi
[2024-01-03 20:04] <cahoots> *uefi
[2024-01-03 20:04] <EriC^^> csm legacy is disabled in the bios?
[2024-01-03 20:04] <cahoots> correct
[2024-01-03 20:04] <EriC^^> right now you're not in uefi btw (the live usb)
[2024-01-03 20:04] <cahoots> oh?
[2024-01-03 20:05] <EriC^^> that's why it cant access the efi variables
[2024-01-03 20:05] <EriC^^> well actually hmm no
[2024-01-03 20:05] <cahoots> when i run "efibootmgr -v" now, i see "Boot0000* next VenHw (99e...0cb)\nBoot0005* UEFI OS HD(2,...\EFI\BOOT...)"
[2024-01-03 20:06] <EriC^^> it is in uefi cause it can access the uefi list, but for some reason it cant save the stuff to the nvram
[2024-01-03 20:06] <cahoots> yeah
[2024-01-03 20:06] <cahoots> i also get "warning: EFI variables cannot be set on this system" when i run `grub-install ...` myself
[2024-01-03 20:07] <EriC^^> cahoots: try to create the default microsoft stuff maybe it would work, sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efi/Microsoft/Boot
[2024-01-03 20:07] <cahoots> after chrooting into my OS on disk
[2024-01-03 20:07] <EriC^^> where /mnt is the efi partition
[2024-01-03 20:07] <cahoots> i see, just that one command to make the dir?
[2024-01-03 20:07] <EriC^^> and then sudo cp /mnt/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /mnt/efi/microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi
[2024-01-03 20:07] <cahoots> kk
[2024-01-03 20:07] <EriC^^> yeah
[2024-01-03 20:08] <EriC^^> make sure secureboot is disabled in the bios cause you're using grubx64 and not shim
[2024-01-03 20:08] <cahoots> i should mount efi first?
[2024-01-03 20:08] <EriC^^> try mokutil --sb-state
[2024-01-03 20:08] <cahoots> mokutil tells me secure boot is disabled
[2024-01-03 20:08] <EriC^^> yeah mount it sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt
[2024-01-03 20:09] <EriC^^> did this used to work before cahoots ?
[2024-01-03 20:10] <cahoots> EriC^^, it's been through a lot of iterations. i had a weird hackintosh setup on here, then i added ubuntu, removed hackintosh, added centos, wiped the centos partition, and found ubuntu wouldn't boot
[2024-01-03 20:10] <EriC^^> aha
[2024-01-03 20:11] <EriC^^> so it used to boot, was it with the same partition table type? i wonder if the uefi for some reason isnt liking that it's mbr
[2024-01-03 20:12] <EriC^^> hmm just saw the parted paste from earlier, never seen this Disk Flags: pmbr_boot flag before
[2024-01-03 20:12] <cahoots> it had two boot-related partitions that i wiped. i then followed boot repair's directions and added a 2mb bios_grub partition and a 512mb boot,esp partition where the two were before
[2024-01-03 20:13] <EriC^^> nevermind it's actually gpt not mbr that you have
[2024-01-03 20:14] <EriC^^> seemed mbr from the uefi entries and stuff
[2024-01-03 20:14] <cahoots> ok, i've run "cd /mnt/efi", at which point i see subdirs "BOOT" and "GRUB", then i've run "sudo mkdir -p Microsoft/Boot && sudo cp GRUB/grubx64.efi Microsoft/Boot/", and will restart
[2024-01-03 20:14] <EriC^^> hmm
[2024-01-03 20:14] <EriC^^> cahoots: it usually is ubuntu/grubx64.efi not grub/
[2024-01-03 20:15] <cahoots> i see
[2024-01-03 20:15] <EriC^^> the grub one might be from the centos or something else
[2024-01-03 20:15] <cahoots> i think all of it has been created from this boot repair tool, as i wiped that data before it did its thing
[2024-01-03 20:16] <EriC^^> also you need to name it bootmgfw.efi
[2024-01-03 20:16] <EriC^^> yeah
[2024-01-03 20:17] <cahoots> ok i now have /mnt/efi/EFI/Micrososft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
[2024-01-03 20:18] <EriC^^> you mean /mnt/efi/microsoft/...?
[2024-01-03 20:19] <cahoots> i do not. i need to make a sibling dir to EFI?
[2024-01-03 20:20] <EriC^^> hmmm earlier you said you cd'd to /mnt/efi and saw 'boot' and 'grub' there
[2024-01-03 20:20] <EriC^^> it should be /mnt/efi/boot /mnt/efi/microsoft/boot
[2024-01-03 20:22] <cahoots> i see, perhaps i misspoke. after running "sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/efi", i have "/mnt/efi/EFI/{BOOT,GRUB,Microsoft}"
[2024-01-03 20:22] <EriC^^> oh ok, all good, except we need ubuntu dir there still
[2024-01-03 20:23] <cahoots> i see
[2024-01-03 20:23] <cahoots> how do i get that
[2024-01-03 20:24] <EriC^^> cahoots: type 'sudo umount /mnt/efi'
[2024-01-03 20:24] <EriC^^> then 'sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt'
[2024-01-03 20:24] <cahoots> done
[2024-01-03 20:25] <EriC^^> then "for i in /dev /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -R $i /mnt$i; done"
[2024-01-03 20:25] <EriC^^> then sudo chroot /mnt
[2024-01-03 20:26] <EriC^^> then "mount /boot/efi" and then run "grub-install --target=x86_64-efi"
[2024-01-03 20:26] <cahoots> "mount: /boot/efi: can't find UUID=19..."
[2024-01-03 20:26] <cahoots> when i do "mount /boot/efi"
[2024-01-03 20:26] <EriC^^> aha that's interesting
[2024-01-03 20:28] <EriC^^> did you run the "for i ..." command?
[2024-01-03 20:28] <EriC^^> outside the chroot?
[2024-01-03 20:28] <cahoots> i did. i ran it from /mnt, was that alright?
[2024-01-03 20:28] <EriC^^> before "sudo chroot /mnt" ?
[2024-01-03 20:28] <cahoots> indeed i ran it before "sudo chroot /mnt"
[2024-01-03 20:29] <EriC^^> odd, what's the output of "blkid | nc termbin.com 9999" ?
[2024-01-03 20:31] <EriC^^> anything in "ls /dev/nvm*" ?
[2024-01-03 20:33] <cahoots> https://termbin.com/avif
[2024-01-03 20:34] <EriC^^> weird the uuid changed since the boot-repair log
[2024-01-03 20:34] <cahoots> "ls /dev/nvm*" (still from within chroot /mnt) returns /dev/nvme0{,n1,n1p2,n1p2,n1p3}
[2024-01-03 20:34] <EriC^^> cahoots: nano /etc/fstab , change the 19... to 9BA0-27A8
[2024-01-03 20:34] <cahoots> i removed the cmos battery for a minute from the mobo and reset the defaults, maybe that's why?
[2024-01-03 20:35] <EriC^^> nope, it's the filesystem uuid, set when it's formatted
[2024-01-03 20:35] <bprompt> cahoots: that doesn't work on today's hardware, used to work about 15 years ago
[2024-01-03 20:35] <cahoots> man
[2024-01-03 20:36] <bprompt> cahoots: and much less in UEFI
[2024-01-03 20:36] <EriC^^> there's a jumper for it
[2024-01-03 20:36] <cahoots> blame it on chatgpt :) i was wondering why nothing was resetting. i haven't found any way to reset stuff like the boot order without manually running efibootmgr for each one
[2024-01-03 20:36] <EriC^^> or you just short the battery holder terminals i guess
[2024-01-03 20:36] <cahoots> ok i've changed the uuid in /etc/fstab
[2024-01-03 20:37] <EriC^^> ok try mount /boot/efi
[2024-01-03 20:37] <cahoots> succeeded
[2024-01-03 20:37] <EriC^^> grub-install --target=x86_64-efi
[2024-01-03 20:38] <cahoots> wow, installation finished, no error reported. previously it said it couldn't set efi vars when i ran a grub-install command
[2024-01-03 20:38] <EriC^^> ok, try "ls -lR /boot/efi | nc termbin.com 9999"
[2024-01-03 20:39] <cahoots> termbin.com/3k7j
[2024-01-03 20:40] <EriC^^> it looks good, sizes match up to ubuntu one
[2024-01-03 20:40] <EriC^^> ok type "exit" to exit the chroot then try rebooting i guess
[2024-01-03 20:40] <EriC^^> oh
[2024-01-03 20:40] <EriC^^> run update-grub before if you want
[2024-01-03 20:41] <EriC^^> before exiting the chroot
[2024-01-03 20:42] <cahoots> so i'd exited chroot, but then i ran chroot again, and then update-grub, and i got https://termbin.com/r6k3e
[2024-01-03 20:44] <EriC^^> looks good
[2024-01-03 20:48] <cahoots> ok i tried rebooting, but it still takes me to mobo settings. i do see a new "ubuntu" entry in the boot sequence above my previously created one
[2024-01-03 20:52] <sem> are you able to select and boot from 'ubuntu' in the mobo settings?
[2024-01-03 20:54] <cahoots> sem, i don't see a way to manually select it, but it is at the top of the boot sequence
[2024-01-03 20:55] <bprompt> cahoots: sounds like the UEFI menu is asking for which entry to default for booting up
[2024-01-03 20:55] <bprompt> cahoots: usually you'd pick one from the boot sequence list and F10 to save and exit
[2024-01-03 20:57] <cahoots> bprompt, ah right, so when i hit f12 and select from the two options, (both with blank names), each causes the machine to reboot
[2024-01-03 20:59] <cahoots> EriC^^, any thoughts?
[2024-01-03 21:03] <pragmaticenigma> cahoots: after spending nearly 4.5 hours.. I'd be throwing in the towel, backing up my data from the system and just do a fresh install, making sure to remove all unused entries from the UEFI settings.
[2024-01-03 21:03] <cahoots> pragmaticenigma, i'm afraid if it won't solve it
[2024-01-03 21:03] <morgan-u2> I have problems. I use 22.04 and I want to graph an equation. I decided to install plots. I get this... The following packages have unmet dependencies:    python3-pyglm : Depends: python3 (< 3.10) but 3.10.6-1~22.04 is to be installed      E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
[2024-01-03 21:05] <morgan-u2> I tried to install python3 and it was already fine ... but not it says:  python is set to manually installed   <-- do I want to change that?
[2024-01-03 21:05] <morgan-u2> python3 is already the newest version (3.10.6-1~22.04).
[2024-01-03 21:06] <pragmaticenigma> cahoots: if that is the case, then the problem isn't Ubuntu, it's your UEFI settings in conflict
[2024-01-03 21:06] <bprompt> morgan-u2:  hmmm if you just want to graph something, why not try .... I mean, does it have to be python?
[2024-01-03 21:06] <bprompt> morgan-u2: are you just trying to graph some equation period, or to have it scripted?
[2024-01-03 21:06] <morgan-u2> I dont know how to program in python.
[2024-01-03 21:07] <bprompt> morgan-u2:  there are many math graphers, what are you trying to do exactly?
[2024-01-03 21:07] <morgan-u2> I  never used it. I tried the hard way but after 34 lessons it was still on boolean tables. It was hard because it was so soooooow.
[2024-01-03 21:07] <morgan-u2> slow
[2024-01-03 21:08] <bprompt> morgan-u2: so you just want to get the equation graphed?  doesn't matter if its Desmos or some other calculator?
[2024-01-03 21:08] <morgan-u2> Exactly,? given a rectangle of a certain (aspect) ratio, plot the height vs the diagonal.
[2024-01-03 21:08] <leftyfb> morgan-u2: ( apt-cache policy python3 ; apt-cache policy python3-pyglm ; python3 --version ; type -a python3 ) | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-03 21:09] <bprompt> hmm
[2024-01-03 21:10] <morgan-u2> weird. I copied that and all my hexchat backscroll vanished. I pasted it into terminal --- trusting you leftyfb -- and it returned a prompt.
[2024-01-03 21:10] <leftyfb> morgan-u2: ( apt-cache policy python3 ; apt-cache policy python3-pyglm ; python3 --version ; type -a python3 ) | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-03 21:10] <leftyfb> it should return a termbin URL
[2024-01-03 21:10] <leftyfb> paste the URL here
[2024-01-03 21:10] <bprompt> morgan-u2: I mean, hell I can write that and graph it in Libreoffice Draw.... not sure if that's what you want, I mean, that's just the pythagorean theorem
[2024-01-03 21:11] <morgan-u2> silly me, it did.
[2024-01-03 21:13] <pragmaticenigma> morgan-u2: can you paste that url it generated here?
[2024-01-03 21:14] <morgan-u2> but no such file or directory.  -- have I grown stupid?
[2024-01-03 21:14] <morgan-u2> https://termbin.com/ysd8
[2024-01-03 21:14] <leftyfb> morgan-u2: remove the "apandada1 PPA
[2024-01-03 21:15] <leftyfb> morgan-u2: if you need pyglm, you'll need to seek support from whoever maintains it. It's not a supported package here
[2024-01-03 21:16] <morgan-u2> I had a ridiculously difficult time doing a trig problem last night. I had to look up what sine and cosine and tangent were to make sure. - it's all about tv and what angle from my eyes the tv screen subtems.  I finally "got it" and found out like 40degrees, and that is the TME maximum recommendation. FWIW
[2024-01-03 21:17] <morgan-u2> leftyfb, ok appendal is on the end but i dont know for sure what a ppa is.
[2024-01-03 21:18] <leftyfb> morgan-u2: ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-03 21:18] <morgan-u2> (since by baskscroll is busted:   ( apt-cache policy python3 ; apt-cache policy python3-pyglm ; python3 --version ; type -a python3 ) | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-03 21:19] <bprompt> morgan-u2: so hmmm if you just want to stick a "certain aspect ratio" and get some result, all that can be done in Bash, well, many languages can do all that, even JS, and yes Python could too
[2024-01-03 21:19] <morgan-u2> https://termbin.com/pgf5c  No such file or directory
[2024-01-03 21:21] <morgan-u2> By this time I want to be able to graph anything I want.  I solved the initial problem with trig. I just did it from the angle of aspect ratio instead of diagonal and recommended distances.  -- I am in it for something new now, tools and competence.
[2024-01-03 21:21] <leftyfb> morgan-u2: the 1st file in that list is the repository you added at some point. That includes the python3-pyglm package which is not a supported package in ubuntu. And since that PPA has other python packages, it's likely to cause other problems
[2024-01-03 21:21] <morgan-u2> OH PPA(I could have had a v8.  I will go look up how to remove a PPA
[2024-01-03 21:23] <bprompt> morgan-u2: so you want some scripted graph?
[2024-01-03 21:23] <morgan-u2> ((
[2024-01-03 21:23] <morgan-u2> Note: You should uninstall the application in Ubuntu which was installed by the PPA before removing the PPA itself.  - - - like I would ever remember.)00
[2024-01-03 21:26] <pragmaticenigma> bprompt: maybe it's best to wait until the Ubuntu issue is resolved
[2024-01-03 21:27] <bprompt> pragmaticenigma: yeah
[2024-01-03 21:29] <morgan-u2> leftyfb,   sudo apt remove ^[[200~'https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/pinta-maintainers/pinta-stable/ubuntu jammy Release'
[2024-01-03 21:29] <morgan-u2>     --- it could not find it. I looked back and did not see that I removed it.  (I wanted and still want to use the application called pinta which came up first as a simple image alteration and manipulation program like MS-paint)
[2024-01-03 21:34] <morgan-u2> And so I got smarter (maybe) about the web-plotter called desmos, and instead of worrying about plots, I am going to RTFM.
[2024-01-03 21:35] <morgan-u2> plots later because pinta is more important to me.
[2024-01-03 21:35] <morgan-u2> Thanks for thelearning curve! leftyfb
[2024-01-03 21:36] <bprompt> heheh
[2024-01-03 21:36] <pragmaticenigma> morgan-u2: General advice, stay away from installing PPAs. While someone might have some really neat program on one, they often a like a trojan army, they can include packages that should already be present on your system. And when you install that PPA, they can take a higher priority and compromise the stability of your computer.
[2024-01-03 21:38] <bprompt> morgan-u2:  quick suggestion, Kolourpaint, is like MSpaint pretty much, the install should be a cinch, mind you that you can do lots of drawing in Libreoffice Draw, and that's already in your system default installation, all you have to do is run it
[2024-01-03 21:38] <pragmaticenigma> In the case of the PPA leftyfb recommended you remove, they included their own Python. Ubuntu (and many other distros) heavily rely upon python for system administrative tasks, and often include refinements for that purpose. Installing a PPA like you did, caused someone elses version of Python to be placed on your system, which is probably why you noticed a significant slow down in operations.
[2024-01-03 21:39] <pragmaticenigma> I'm not sure how to undo those things, leftyfb appears to have stepped away for a moment, but if you haven't restored your system, hang around and wait for them to reply. If you already removed the PPA before you removed the software, I'm not sure how to fix that.
[2024-01-03 21:43] <morgan-u2> bprompt, I dont want to draw. I want to cut up images and place them. Add text. Wish I could desaturate and layer things but that is prolly over my pay grade.)
[2024-01-03 21:43] <morgan-u2> I wil look up paygrade.
[2024-01-03 21:43] <bprompt> morgan-u2: then Kolourpaint will do, is very much like MSpaint
[2024-01-03 21:44] <morgan-u2> pragmaticenigma,  I understand that. I cannot remember installing any python but obviously I did. I agree with you that I only want the standard python.
[2024-01-03 21:46] <morgan-u2> Is there a way I can tell the date at which i did a clean install on this partition?
[2024-01-03 21:46] <morgan-u2> If it looks like something is twisted, I can do that again.
[2024-01-03 21:46] <pragmaticenigma> morgan-u2: Python is installed by default with Ubuntu. The issue with the PPA is that it also included a package for Python, and had set itself up with a higher priority, which means if Ubuntu releases a security patch, you may not receive it until the other PPA maintainer updates theirs.
[2024-01-03 21:47] <morgan-u2> I would like to lern how I can make some kind of file that would auto-instll the set of what I consider basic programs to add-on and let it fly.
[2024-01-03 21:47] <pragmaticenigma> when you remove a PPA, it should restore itself back to the original source. I'm not certain on that. Was hoping leftyfb might jump back in and help verify those things
[2024-01-03 21:48] <bprompt> morgan-u2: your error is with "plot" package, right?
[2024-01-03 21:48] <bprompt> morgan-u2:  I mean, it has unmet dependencies
[2024-01-03 21:48] <morgan-u2> Otherwise I have to go through all those "what to do after you install Ubuntu" webpages again and remember. (wry grin)
[2024-01-03 21:51] <pragmaticenigma> Personally, I keep a journal so I know when I've done certain actions with `apt` on my machine. so that I can later undo them.
[2024-01-03 21:56] <bprompt> morgan-u2: if the issue is the installaiton of "plots", then simply uninstall it, use something else, for you what you specified, you don't quite need it, and the dependencies for python3-pyglm won't be an issue since "plots" would be tossed anyhow
[2024-01-03 21:57] <bprompt> morgan-u2: I mean, I do lots in Libreoffice Draw, but is mainly math stuff, mind you that the difference is Kolourpaint is "rasterized" whilst Draw is "vectorized"
[2024-01-03 22:00] <morgan-u2> bprompt, that last is interesting. My frined says he gets images off of the web then alters them in MS-Paint. He for sure adds text. That works to produce a jpg (rasterized oc)
[2024-01-03 22:01] <bprompt> morgan-u2: I do that all the time =)
[2024-01-03 22:02] <morgan-u2> bprompt, now that issue is what if things are slow because i have a wrong version of python. But no. I already said that I used apt to update python and it looed good.
[2024-01-03 22:02] <bprompt> grab images, annotate them, slap a triangle and equations, usually I do a combination of both Kolourpaint and Draw
[2024-01-03 22:02] <morgan-u2> Can I tell the date I installed this ubuntu the first time?
[2024-01-03 22:04] <bprompt> morgan-u2:   well, from the message I read from you and your console  output, doesn' t seem like, you "have the wrong python version for python3-pyglm to work with", is all, and python3-pyglm( which you don't  need, let's not get OCD now ), is requiring an "older version of python3", you have 3.10 and that package needs (< 3.10) so something like 3.8 or such
[2024-01-03 22:04] <bprompt> morgan-u2: so you have the "righ version", usually comes with the default install, just not the "right one" for python3-pyglm
[2024-01-03 22:06] <bprompt> morgan-u2: but since  you don't need "plots" and python3-pyglm, you're golden, install Kolourpaint and achieve Nirvana :)
[2024-01-03 22:07] <bprompt> morgan-u2: just toss "plots" assuming it installed some things that are just superfluous
[2024-01-03 22:09] <morgan-u2> I am beholden to neither plots nor pinta.  I mean attached...
[2024-01-03 22:10] <bprompt> morgan-u2: good, I mention Kolourpaint because is what I use, there are others, but that's one that's about the same as MSPaint
[2024-01-03 22:11] <EriC^^> cahoots: sorry was away
[2024-01-03 22:11] <EriC^^> cahoots: you could try booting it in csm legacy mode, you do have a bios_boot partition, see what happens
[2024-01-03 22:12] <EriC^^> cahoots: which pc make is it?
[2024-01-03 22:13] <EriC^^> f12 is giving you the run-time boot menu?
[2024-01-03 22:14] <morgan-u2> That is all I want at present. I like juztaposing pictures. Laer I would like ot adjust them to similar resplutions or dissimilar and maybe to color (correct or shift). I need to shrink or stretch and combine. edit borders, add framing, text overlay and a bit of color picking or section picking and printing that over a piece to erase soe background - - google claims to do a lot with the pixel tools but I dont
[2024-01-03 22:14] <morgan-u2> know. Their tools come and go. I fondly remember Picaseaa.
[2024-01-03 22:15] <morgan-u2> bprompt is gone.oh,np. (I had to give up seeing joins and parts too noisy.)
[2024-01-03 22:15] <morgan-u2> bye bye and thanks.
[2024-01-04 01:04] <plujon> I have an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine, and I want to update Apache from 2.4.41 to 2.4.47 or newer.  Is there a common way to achieve this?
[2024-01-04 01:04] <rbox> well if its not in the repos, you could compile it
[2024-01-04 01:04] <leftyfb> plujon: upgrade the OS to 22.04
[2024-01-04 01:04] <rbox> i didnt evne know people still used apache
[2024-01-04 01:04] <rbox> lol
[2024-01-04 01:05] <oerheks> what happens when you enable HWE?
[2024-01-04 01:05] <plujon> rbox: Thanks; is that the usual approach when one wants newer software?
[2024-01-04 01:05] <oerheks> !hwe
[2024-01-04 01:05] <ubottu> The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
[2024-01-04 01:05] <leftyfb> I still use it heavily
[2024-01-04 01:05] <oerheks> no reason not to upgrade to 22.04 indeed
[2024-01-04 01:05] <leftyfb> huh?
[2024-01-04 01:06] <leftyfb> it's a release from almost 4 years ago and potentially a public hosting server running a very popular attach vector. Time to upgrade
[2024-01-04 01:09] <plujon> Thanks; I'll upgrade the OS.  I'm not sure how the LTS Enablement Stacks fits in.
[2024-01-04 01:09] <leftyfb> it doesn't
[2024-01-04 01:09] <oerheks> it would give the latestest kernel though
[2024-01-04 01:10] <oerheks> c/latest
[2024-01-04 01:10] <leftyfb> which doesn't help with getting a later version of apache
[2024-01-04 01:11] <oerheks> indeed
[2024-01-04 01:12] <oerheks> and before using ondrj ppa or such, one must need to understand the differences
[2024-01-04 01:12] <JanC> apache is in main so it gets security updates, but if you need a newer Apache for some reason it's probably easiest to upgrade the OS
[2024-01-04 01:12] <oerheks> current https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2
[2024-01-04 01:13] <oerheks> all got patched
[2024-01-04 01:13] <JanC> also depending on what else runs on that machine, of course
[2024-01-04 01:19] <cryptonector> Is there a way to configure the lock screen so it doesn't blank (when running on wall power anyways)?
[2024-01-04 01:20] <leftyfb> yes
[2024-01-04 01:21] <cryptonector> er, right, so, how does one configure that?
[2024-01-04 01:22] <leftyfb> cryptonector: set "screen blank" to "Never" in the power settings
[2024-01-04 01:23] <cryptonector> leftyfb: right, I've done that, and still
[2024-01-04 01:23] <cryptonector> that just causes the screen not to blank unless it locks
[2024-01-04 01:24] <leftyfb> gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-timeout 0
[2024-01-04 01:32] <cryptonector> hmm, no, that doesn't do it; this is 22.04 fyi, and everything I find is that this can't be done; oh well
[2024-01-04 01:33] <cryptonector> also, how does one open issues?
[2024-01-04 01:33] <cryptonector> I'd like to report issues with sticky keys, for example
[2024-01-04 01:33] <leftyfb> !bug | cryptonector
[2024-01-04 01:33] <ubottu> cryptonector: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its official !flavors, please report it using the command Â« ubuntu-bug <package> Â» - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[2024-01-04 01:33] <oerheks> maybe you need to logout/login again to take effect?
[2024-01-04 01:33] <cryptonector> oerheks: oh, there's an idea, yeah
[2024-01-04 01:34] <cryptonector> leftyfb: how would I find what package implements accessibility features?
[2024-01-04 01:36] <pragmaticenigma> most of those would be part of the Gnome Desktop package
[2024-01-04 01:36] <pragmaticenigma> unless there is a specific feature you are looking at?
[2024-01-04 01:37] <pragmaticenigma> (I'm missing a portion of the conversation, so I apologies if this is making you repeat something)
[2024-01-04 01:43] <cryptonector> pragmaticenigma: there's bugs in sticky keys, like some modifier combinations can be pressed together and the obvious thing results, but others result in the modifiers being stuck on instead
[2024-01-04 01:43] <cryptonector> for example, ctrl-alt works fine if I press them together, but crtl-shift causes both to get stuck on
[2024-01-04 01:44] <cryptonector> the context is that sticky keys is a great feature for dealing with RSI, because one can avoid "deviations" that exacerbate or cause RSI
[2024-01-04 01:45] <cryptonector> typically the way sticky keys work is that if you press and let go a modifier key then it will be as if you kept holding it for the ultimate non-modifier key you strike
[2024-01-04 01:45] <cryptonector> and if you hit a modifier key twice then it will be stuck on (like capslock, but for all keys, not just letters)
[2024-01-04 01:46] <cryptonector> now, I don't always use this "correctly" -- sometimes I do hold one or more modifiers rather than press and release, and that's still supposed to work, but in Ubuntu 22.04 this is inconsistent
[2024-01-04 01:47] <pragmaticenigma> what is the status of "Disable if two keys are pressed together" in settings?
[2024-01-04 01:47] <cryptonector> off -- I don't want that
[2024-01-04 01:48] <cryptonector> in X11 this works better (and there's more settings, too); in Windows it works fine as well
[2024-01-04 01:49] <pragmaticenigma> Windows or wayland?
[2024-01-04 01:52] <cryptonector> I'm using Ubuntu 22.04, so Wayland
[2024-01-04 01:53] <pragmaticenigma> cryptonector: is Repeat Keys enabled?
[2024-01-04 01:53] <cryptonector> lemme see
[2024-01-04 01:53] <cryptonector> it's on
[2024-01-04 01:53] <pragmaticenigma> I wonder if that's how the sticky keys get stuck on... might not be compatible?
[2024-01-04 01:54] <cryptonector> turning Repeat Keys off made no difference
[2024-01-04 01:54] <cryptonector> (Slow Keys and Bounce Keys are both off)
[2024-01-04 01:55] <cryptonector> anyways, if I knew the pkg name I'd report the bug
[2024-01-04 01:55] <pragmaticenigma> interesting
[2024-01-04 01:55] <cryptonector> heck, i might look and see if I can spot the bug
[2024-01-04 01:55] <cryptonector> as it is I've no idea where sticky keys is implemented
[2024-01-04 01:55] <pragmaticenigma> I'm working on figuring out if there is a specific package, or if it would just fall under Gnome Desktop/Ubuntu Desktop
[2024-01-04 01:56] <cryptonector> I suppose Ubuntu Desktop might suffice
[2024-01-04 01:56] <cryptonector> off
[2024-01-04 01:57] <pragmaticenigma> cryptonector: I think ubuntu-desktop would be the right choice to make, if it's not it at least narrows down the scope for someone to accurately adjust the package if needed
[2024-01-04 02:00] <cryptonector> pragmaticenigma: thanks; I guess I've to make an account and stuff
[2024-01-04 02:01] <pragmaticenigma> yep, pretty painless, but there may be some diags they ask you to run, so they'll want to be able to reach you
[2024-01-04 02:14] <cryptonector> pragmaticenigma: thanks!  2047989
[2024-01-04 02:15] <arraybolt3> ubottu can even do a cool thing: Bug #2047989
[2024-01-04 02:15] <arraybolt3> boom
[2024-01-04 02:15] <cryptonector> also, how do I tell if I'm paying for any Ubuntu services?  I'd like to
[2024-01-04 02:16] <arraybolt3> if you donate, you are, otherwise you're not :) Ubuntu is free.
[2024-01-04 02:16] <pragmaticenigma> cryptonector: You can choose to pay for Ubuntu Pro (it's free for up-to 5 personal computer.) Canonical has made it their mission to keep Ubuntu free, they only charge for premium support.
[2024-01-04 02:17] <rbox> cryptonector: you dont know if someone is taking money from you every month?
[2024-01-04 02:18] <pragmaticenigma> cryptonector: The Ubuntu Pro pricing is enterprise costs, not really intended for consumer/individual people
[2024-01-04 02:18] <arraybolt3> rbox: meh, Windows can try to pull crud like getting you to sign up for a service that they then want to charge your card for (looking squarely at Office 365), so it's a legitimate question.
[2024-01-04 02:18] <rbox> and you have no clue they're taking money from you every month?
[2024-01-04 02:18] <arraybolt3> thankfully there's no Ubuntu+ service or anything weird like that out there
[2024-01-04 02:18] <pragmaticenigma> There is TuxCare arraybolt3
[2024-01-04 02:19] <pragmaticenigma> so there are things out there, but targeting enterprise level clients
[2024-01-04 02:19] <arraybolt3> pragmaticenigma: that's run by a totally different company I think. I guess technically there are *services* like that, but none of them are related to Ubuntu or Canonical except Ubuntu Pro, which, like you said, is something enterprises or large businesses would buy. Small businesses and individuals can just use it (or not, either way).
[2024-01-04 02:20] <pragmaticenigma> Ubuntu One used to be a paid service, I think that was rolled into Ubuntu Pro
[2024-01-04 02:20] <pragmaticenigma> (mind is fuzzy on that one)
[2024-01-04 02:32] <heyguys> there's an ubuntu pro?
[2024-01-04 02:32] <heyguys> hmm didn't know
[2024-01-04 02:36] <leftyfb> !pro | heyguys
[2024-01-04 02:36] <ubottu> heyguys: Ubuntu Pro is a service offered by Canonical for expanded CVE patching, ten-years security maintenance and optional support. Anyone can use Ubuntu Pro for free for personal use on up to 5 machines. For details please see https://ubuntu.com/pro and https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-pro-faq
[2024-01-04 02:36] <leftyfb> heyguys: it's probably not what you think. It's not a different distribution
[2024-01-04 02:36] <heyguys> oh i see
[2024-01-04 02:56] <Kangarooo> how can i see if live usb is ubuntu or other version? what file in live usb is for distro and version?
[2024-01-04 02:59] <rbox> Kangarooo: cat /etc/*release*
[2024-01-04 03:04] <guiverc> Kangarooo, I usually look at header of /etc/apt/sources.list as it has the ISO date there  (release details don't change during stages; eg. alpha/beta/rc-released being the same).. thru to .1,.2, .3 etc) but each distribution can have its own means of identification, thus you cannot be 100% accurate
[2024-01-04 03:08] <pragmaticenigma> Kangarooo: Look for a folder under /dists ... you can cross reference with https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases to convert it to the release version number
[2024-01-04 03:10] <Kangarooo> thx rbox guiverc pragmaticenigma
[2024-01-04 03:11] <guiverc> (other answers are probably more useful than mine... mine is specific to ubuntu & detecting different Ubuntu ISOs, eg. today's daily of noble versus yesterday etc.. where other checks will report all as identical where they're not)
[2024-01-04 03:26] <Kangarooo> nope guiverc yours works on every version even non-ubuntu. only yours helped he find i had some other non-ubuntu old usb
[2024-01-04 03:27] <guiverc> I'd still not expect it to work with every GNU/Linux (there are so many, most rather similar but some are not)
[2024-01-04 03:27] <Kangarooo> how do i report but in 22.04 live usb about firefox that its location question popup when switching to non-firefox window, still appears floating in middle?
[2024-01-04 03:28] <Kangarooo> guiverc: well this one was not ubuntu so other suggested files were not there
[2024-01-04 03:29] <guiverc> I doubt there is a single answer that covers everything (even just GNU/Linux, let alone inc. BSD & more) so the more ways of detecting, the better you'll be (why I offered my ^ 2c)
[2024-01-04 03:31] <pragmaticenigma> Kangarooo: Firefox has regular updates, it's possible that it's already been fixed, but ISO images are not typically updated after release
[2024-01-04 03:32] <pragmaticenigma> !bug | Kangarooo, otherwise...
[2024-01-04 03:32] <ubottu> Kangarooo, otherwise...: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its official !flavors, please report it using the command Â« ubuntu-bug <package> Â» - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.

[2024-01-04 05:47] <ubottu> tommy__: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience

[2024-01-04 13:05] <Photonic> there is a problem with ubuntu pro where its blocking the download of updates in Universe in 20.04
[2024-01-04 13:05] <Photonic> to get the update, you have to remove the package and reinstall it
[2024-01-04 13:14] <Photonic> there is a problem with ubuntu pro where its blocking the download of updates from the Universe repo in 20.04
[2024-01-04 13:22] <lotuspsychje> !ubuntupro | Photonic start here
[2024-01-04 13:22] <lotuspsychje> !pro
[2024-01-04 13:22] <ubottu> Ubuntu Pro is a service offered by Canonical for expanded CVE patching, ten-years security maintenance and optional support. Anyone can use Ubuntu Pro for free for personal use on up to 5 machines. For details please see https://ubuntu.com/pro and https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-pro-faq
[2024-01-04 13:22] <Photonic> I know what it is, but there is a problem with it
[2024-01-04 13:22] <lotuspsychje> Photonic: is apt giving you errors?
[2024-01-04 13:23] <pragmaticenigma> Photonic: There's little we can do, except recommend un-enrolling the machine from Ubuntu Pro. Give it some time, and it will likely work itself out.
[2024-01-04 13:24] <Photonic> no, its saying to download the update to subscribe to ubuntu pro, but 20.04 isn't 5 years old yet. I should be getting the update without needing to sign up. plus, the universe is the community-maintained repo.
[2024-01-04 13:24] <Yakov> My naitulus does not respond, how to debug?
[2024-01-04 13:24] <ravage> Photonic: if you dont want the updates you can just ignore that message
[2024-01-04 13:24] <ravage> or subscribe to pro for free
[2024-01-04 13:25] <Photonic> ravage i want the update, its for security
[2024-01-04 13:25] <Photonic> the problem is ubuntu pro
[2024-01-04 13:25] <pragmaticenigma> Photonic: Those updates are not in Universe. Go and read the Ubuntu Pro, there are specific packages that are only released to machines enrolled/enabled with Ubuntu Pro. It is explained in the documentation.
[2024-01-04 13:25] <ravage> i dont see a problem so far then
[2024-01-04 13:25] <Photonic> i checked the package, its in the universe repo
[2024-01-04 13:25] <ravage> that is the unpatched version yes
[2024-01-04 13:25] <Photonic> huh?
[2024-01-04 13:25] <Photonic> its the same app
[2024-01-04 13:26] <Photonic> in universe
[2024-01-04 13:26] <ravage> please read the documentation
[2024-01-04 13:26] <pragmaticenigma> Photonic: the releases in Ubuntu Pro do not hold back security patches, only feature enhancements.
[2024-01-04 13:26] <pragmaticenigma> Photonic: You have clearly not read the documentation on Ubuntu Pro
[2024-01-04 13:26] <ravage> pragmaticenigma: it does
[2024-01-04 13:26] <Photonic> im not interested in ubuntu pro's doc coz im not interested in ubuntu pro. what im interested in is getting the update for the community-maintained app which ubuntu pro is blocking
[2024-01-04 13:27] <ravage> pro is not blocking anything
[2024-01-04 13:27] <ravage> there is no patch available in universe
[2024-01-04 13:27] <Photonic> yes it is, because when i remove the app and reinstall it, the app is patched
[2024-01-04 13:27] <Photonic> no more security notices from apt
[2024-01-04 13:27] <ravage> very unlikely
[2024-01-04 13:27] <Photonic> try it
[2024-01-04 13:28] <Photonic> sign out of ubuntu pro
[2024-01-04 13:28] <Photonic> cop the notice
[2024-01-04 13:28] <ravage> you said you do not use ubuntu pro
[2024-01-04 13:28] <Photonic> remove the app and re-install it. then check apt - patched
[2024-01-04 13:28] <Photonic> no more security notice
[2024-01-04 13:28] <Photonic> so ubuntu pro is blocking it
[2024-01-04 13:29] <pragmaticenigma> that logic means nothing
[2024-01-04 13:29] <pragmaticenigma> other than a lack of understanding
[2024-01-04 13:29] <Photonic> it means there is a problem with ubuntu pro because it wont let me download the update, but when i remove the app and reinstall it, i no longer get the security notice from apt
[2024-01-04 13:30] <ravage> ok. we do not support Ubuntu Pro here anyway
[2024-01-04 13:30] <Photonic> all good
[2024-01-04 13:30] <ravage> so try to contact Canonical about it
[2024-01-04 13:30] <Photonic> thanks
[2024-01-04 13:39] <ecdhe> Ubuntu 22.  When I enable Sharing->Remote Desktop and then do a "netstat -an | grep 3389" I can see that the gnome remote desktop service is only listening on ipv6.  There's no indication in journalctl that a bind() failed... how to debug?
[2024-01-04 13:40] <ravage> what makes you think it is v6 only? what is the exact output?
[2024-01-04 13:53] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-04 16:45] <random-jellyfish> in dash-to-dock isolate-workspaces is not working
[2024-01-04 16:46] <random-jellyfish> it's always set to true I can't change it, and the apps in the taskbar are the same in all workspaces
[2024-01-04 16:46] <random-jellyfish> I want each workspace to have its own list of open apps shown in the taskbar
[2024-01-04 16:46] <random-jellyfish> does anybody know a fix for this?
[2024-01-04 16:58] <ioria> random-jellyfish, what you mean ' i can't change it' ?
[2024-01-04 17:00] <roddy> Can I ask questions about kernel 6.6 crashing on dell xps 8940? 6.5 boots fine.
[2024-01-04 17:01] <roddy> I read somewhere the ubuntu mainline kernel broke after 6.6 started?
[2024-01-04 17:02] <pragmaticenigma> roddy: You can ask questions about anything Ubuntu, that is sourced from official Ubuntu respositories. Making a statement "I read somewhere..." doesn't help anyone unless you have a citation to that source as the validity can then be confirmed. Otherwise it could just be one persons bad experience and an assumption to the reason about it.
[2024-01-04 17:04] <random-jellyfish> ioria, "gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock isolate-workspaces true" does nothing
[2024-01-04 17:05] <random-jellyfish> if I try to set it to false it's still trye
[2024-01-04 17:05] <random-jellyfish> true*
[2024-01-04 17:16] <roberto_> Hey to all!
[2024-01-04 18:01] <random-jellyfish> so basically workspace isolation in gnome for ubuntu 22.04 can't be done?
[2024-01-04 18:02] <pragmaticenigma> random-jellyfish: you got that from what exactly? I didn't see anyone respond, which means that at the moment, no one has an answer to help you with your question.
[2024-01-04 18:03] <pragmaticenigma> random-jellyfish: I can't determine if dash-to-dock is included with Ubuntu or not. If it is something you installed from the Gnome extensions website, it wouldn't be suppotred here. You would have to seek help from the developer's offerings for support, or another resource.
[2024-01-04 18:16] <ioria> random-jellyfish, can you try this : https://gist.github.com/yucer/6016c4e225b8947662ebf2c46a86623d
[2024-01-04 18:16] <tomreyn> fwiw, ubuntu, by default, ships 'ubuntu dock', a fork of the dash-to-dock gnome-shell extension.

[2024-01-04 18:18] <random-jellyfish> ioria, yes I have them all set to true but it doesn't work
[2024-01-04 18:19] <random-jellyfish> tomreyn, I'll have a look at that thanks
[2024-01-04 18:20] <random-jellyfish> tomreyn, seems it was already installed
[2024-01-04 18:20] <ioria> random-jellyfish, do you have gnome-tweaks already installed ?
[2024-01-04 18:20] <expatjedi> Is there any version or fork of ubuntu that comes with only necessary packages, no gui? I mean like arch linux.
[2024-01-04 18:21] <random-jellyfish> ioria, yes gnome-tweaks is installed
[2024-01-04 18:21] <ioria> random-jellyfish, maybe there something checked there
[2024-01-04 18:21] <lotuspsychje> expatjedi: some ubuntu installers give a minimal packages option, there's also ubuntu server
[2024-01-04 18:23] <expatjedi> lotuspsychje, do you know any spesific distro name?
[2024-01-04 18:23] <tomreyn> and debootstrap, too
[2024-01-04 18:24] <tomreyn> all of this refers to ubuntu. not a different distribution.
[2024-01-04 18:25] <lotuspsychje> expatjedi: ubuntu had a bubbly road on a minimal option, so some releases have it and some not
[2024-01-04 18:26] <expatjedi> Thanks tomreyn, debootstrap is the solution I've been looking for
[2024-01-04 18:29] <tomreyn> expatjedi: it's not really an official installation method, i think, but you should still end up with a supportable system. after all, you'll (have) notice(d) there are many dependencies pulling in other packages, so the chance to end up with something that's close to what the "minimal" installer option installs is not that different.
[2024-01-04 18:31] <lotuspsychje> expatjedi: there's also a xubuntu core out there you could give a try with a pretty minimal base
[2024-01-04 18:36] <pragmaticenigma> expatjedi: would say that for a very minimal install, Ubuntu Server is about as minimal as it comes. There's no GUI, and there is no default services installed. Just the bare minimum for a what would become a server instance.
[2024-01-04 18:36] <pragmaticenigma> expatjedi: during the install process there is a ballot screen to choose a role, but you don't have to select anything.
[2024-01-04 18:37] <pragmaticenigma> which would avoid installation of packages you're not interested in
[2024-01-04 18:41] <expatjedi> I really don't want to use plymouth
[2024-01-04 18:41] <expatjedi> xfce4 extras
[2024-01-04 18:41] <expatjedi> office programs, unnecessary media plugins and players
[2024-01-04 18:42] <expatjedi> I just wanna install minimal base of ubuntu that's all
[2024-01-04 18:42] <pragmaticenigma> expatjedi: Server doesn't use a boot screen (plymouth) it's all text
[2024-01-04 18:43] <expatjedi> but it comes with several apps that does not need on desktop
[2024-01-04 18:44] <pragmaticenigma> nothing is perfect friend, but better several apps that are just an `apt purge` away from being gone, than the hundreds for Ubuntu Desktop
[2024-01-04 18:46] <expatjedi> would it be better to publish base installation image for advanced users?
[2024-01-04 18:46] <expatjedi> options options that's all we need
[2024-01-04 18:47] <expatjedi> anyway thank you very much for your opinions and helps
[2024-01-04 18:47] <expatjedi> good night fellas
[2024-01-04 18:48] <pragmaticenigma> wonder what packages they deemed superfluous to the minimal Server install option.
[2024-01-04 18:55] <Square> I've decided I must ditch my nvidia card and get a AMD Radeon for linux use. Are there some hints of advice anyone could give on such purchase. I've been eyeing "RX 7600" (Sapphire PULSE).
[2024-01-04 18:58] <pragmaticenigma> Square: The focus of this channel is for support. Not for asking on opinions or taking polls. If you want those, please ask in #ubuntu-offtopic. Some advice though, make sure to test your system with the opensource drivers. The only reason to install the AMD proprietary drivers is if you need access to the Compute cores directly on the card. All other functions are covered by the AMD provided opensource drivers.
[2024-01-04 18:59] <Square> sorry
[2024-01-04 19:00] <bprompt> Square: that said by pragmaticenigma , I have an AMD Ryzen, sometime ago I installed the AMD drivers, saw no difference in performance to without them, so the installation driver works just the same, for my case, there was no need since there was no difference
[2024-01-04 19:01] <Square> bprompt, Thanks. I was talking GPU here though.
[2024-01-04 19:03] <bprompt> Square: needless to say, I toss the AMD I downloaded, since it was just an unnecessary extra 300Mbs, as far as GPU go, last I checked Intel as well as AMD have it in the same die with the cpu, so as I said, I don't recall noticing any advantages or any noticeable ones for that matter
[2024-01-04 19:04] <bprompt> Square: so the installation drivers is what I'm running right now, works fine
[2024-01-04 19:09] <Kangarooo> what is name of installation wizzard for ubuntu or kubuntu?
[2024-01-04 19:12] <arraybolt3> Kangarooo: It depends on which version. For all versions of Kubuntu and most versions of Ubuntu, it's Ubiquity. For newer versions of Ubuntu, it's the Ubuntu Desktop Installer.
[2024-01-04 19:12] <tomreyn> Kangarooo: the latter is https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-installer
[2024-01-04 19:23] <kangaroooo> In https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/speechd-setup?as=u&utm_source=inproduct written to do apt command. Were somewhere not an apt shortlink that opens in computer from brwser url?
[2024-01-04 19:25] <pragmaticenigma> kangaroooo: Can you rephrase your question, I don't understand what you're asking
[2024-01-04 19:25] <bprompt> kangaroooo: are  you asking how to install "speech-dispatcher"?
[2024-01-04 19:26] <nbdy> hi all
[2024-01-04 19:26] <bprompt> nbdy: allo allo
[2024-01-04 19:27] <tomreyn> i'm guessing that kangaroooo is asking "wasn't there a way to have clickable apt:... links in web pages"
[2024-01-04 19:27] <pragmaticenigma> tomreyn: that's what I think is the question too. and to that, I'm glad there isn't. that's a dangerous feature that someone could accidentally click on and install things they didn't intend to
[2024-01-04 19:27] <kangaroooo> yes clicable apt how to find some places?
[2024-01-04 19:28] <kangaroooo> i want to suggest in that page afeature to add clickable apt links
[2024-01-04 19:28] <nbdy> I want to raise a vpn server, but it must be fully transparent for sites and it is impossible to determine to the website or service in internet that traffic is going through a vpn. what can you advise?
[2024-01-04 19:29] <pragmaticenigma> kangaroooo: it's unlikely to happen. there is no defined url scheme for software center applications. The scheme on a url is what programs use to decide how to handle a link, and dispatch it to the correct program when it cannot handle it on it's own.
[2024-01-04 19:29] <tomreyn> !info apturl
[2024-01-04 19:29] <ubottu> apturl (0.5.2ubuntu22, mantic): install packages using the apt protocol - GTK+ frontend. In component universe, is optional. Built by apturl. Size 9 kB / 55 kB
[2024-01-04 19:30] <tomreyn> used to be in main a while ago
[2024-01-04 19:30] <kangaroooo> oh, it will work only when installed? wasnt some websites where can find packages and they will have links that work out of box?
[2024-01-04 19:31] <bprompt> kangaroooo: I think that may require you a signup with that forum at mozilla, once registered, then you can add material, but doesn't look you'd be able to for that page specifically
[2024-01-04 19:32] <bprompt> kangaroooo: nope, I don't think, pretty sure, browsers don't have an "apt://" protocol to install stuff right from a link in the browser, not to mention the huge security consideration for that
[2024-01-04 19:34] <nbdy> Any ideas? :)
[2024-01-04 19:35] <tomreyn> nbdy: this is at least bordering off-topic. and the system architecture is not clear. there are different types of vpn's and i'm not sure which one you have in mind.
[2024-01-04 19:35] <pragmaticenigma> nbdy: this probably isn't the best place for getting an answer to that. Focus here is on Ubuntu Desktop and it's available software. Configuration and slection of VPN protocols would be better served in forums dedicated to network security, networking, or similar
[2024-01-04 19:43] <ecdhe> ravage: What makes me think it's v6 only?  It might be the fact that netstat only shows tcp6 :::3389 LISTEN but no corresponding tcp 0.0.0.0:22 LISTEN entry
[2024-01-04 19:44] <ecdhe> On top of that I cannot connect from a nearby host
[2024-01-04 19:44] <ecdhe> But I can connect on port 22 just fine
[2024-01-04 19:44] <ravage> a tcp6 socket usually also accepts v4 IPs
[2024-01-04 19:44] <alex_> Hello! I have a constant annoying static noise in my headset when I use ubuntu (does not happen on windows or live USB). I am using Realtek ALC3246 on a dell inspiron. I've tried all there is to try in alsamixer and the power settings, but that did not help. How can I diagnose this issue better?
[2024-01-04 19:45] <nbdy> Why so? There is Ubuntu Channel and always in the past it was the better place for similar questions.
[2024-01-04 19:46] <alex_> where should I ask then nbdy ?
[2024-01-04 19:46] <pragmaticenigma> alex_: that wasn't directed at you
[2024-01-04 19:46] <ecdhe> nbdy: try #security if you have security questions
[2024-01-04 19:46] <alex_> oh sorry for that
[2024-01-04 19:48] <pragmaticenigma> alex_: Is windows installed on the same hardware as your Ubuntu installation?
[2024-01-04 19:48] <pragmaticenigma> alex_: when you were testing
[2024-01-04 19:48] <alex_> I have a dual boot. One with Arch, other with ubuntu 18.04LTS and other with windows
[2024-01-04 19:48] <alex_> pragmaticenigma,
[2024-01-04 19:49] <leftyfb> alex_: Ubuntu 18.04 is End of Life and not supported
[2024-01-04 19:49] <leftyfb> alex_: install Ubuntu 22.04 and let us know if you still have the issue
[2024-01-04 19:50] <alex_> oh
[2024-01-04 19:50] <alex_> so I have to format and reinstall
[2024-01-04 19:50] <leftyfb> alex_: if it were me, that is what I would do. It is possible, but non-trival to upgrade from an EOL release, but I would not recommend it
[2024-01-04 19:51] <lubuntu> show me the money
[2024-01-04 19:51] <alex_> I'm certanly going to screw everything up if I do upgrade lol
[2024-01-04 19:51] <leftyfb> lubuntu: can we help you with something?
[2024-01-04 19:51] <tomreyn> more correctly, 18.04 is beyond end of standard support, not end of life if you have extended support.
[2024-01-04 19:52] <leftyfb> true
[2024-01-04 19:52] <kangaroooo> tomreyn bprompt https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptURL here is apt url work out of box- opens on Kubuntu Discovery packaga manager
[2024-01-04 19:53] <kangaroooo> apt:speech-dispatcher
[2024-01-04 19:53] <alex_> okay
[2024-01-04 19:53] <alex_> thanks all
[2024-01-04 19:53] <tomreyn> kangaroooo: i see
[2024-01-04 19:54] <bprompt> kangaroooo: I see, I suspected it was added as protocol, well, right, it simply opens up either "xdg open" or whatever handler you have it for it
[2024-01-04 19:55] <bprompt> kangaroooo: for your case and webbrowser, it opens the package manager, for mine it prompts for "xdg open", which likely takes it to the package manager anyhow
[2024-01-04 19:55] <kangaroooo> pragmaticenigma tomreyn bpromptÂ  but it cant open speech-dispatcher i made a bug with your help https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plasma-discover/+bug/2048117
[2024-01-04 19:57] <tomreyn> that's hardly a bug
[2024-01-04 19:58] <pragmaticenigma> indeed... and Mozilla's site is quite indepth on the steps needed to install the package.
[2024-01-04 19:59] <pragmaticenigma> kangaroooo: what is likely the source of the issue is that the package (which doesn't appear to have been updated since 2012) doesn't have the needed metadata for the search function in software center to find the package.
[2024-01-04 20:00] <pragmaticenigma> woops... apturl is old, not speech-dispatcher
[2024-01-04 20:17] <bprompt> Kangarooo: https://jsbin.com/wimilutohi   <--- does that work for you?  that's the name of the package btw, but as I said, it depends on the webbrowser handler
[2024-01-04 20:18] <bprompt> Kangarooo: will depend on the webbrowser handler, and also if the distribution has it in its repositories
[2024-01-04 20:19] <pragmaticenigma> bprompt: The issue isn't the handler, the issue raised was that once it was enabled, the package wasn't listed in software center which is an entirely different issue.
[2024-01-04 20:20] <pragmaticenigma> bprompt: the ticket highlights that software center didn't display the desired package
[2024-01-04 20:21] <bprompt> pragmaticenigma: right, does for me, since it's in these repository, but right, will be dependent on those factors
[2024-01-04 20:22] <pragmaticenigma> I've had lots of issues with Discover from KDE in the past. I think there's more an issue with Discover and how it loads and parses the metadata of packages
[2024-01-04 20:22] <pragmaticenigma> Discover being the software center used by Kubuntu
[2024-01-04 20:23] <bprompt> right
[2024-01-04 20:25] <Kangarooo> pragmaticenigma:  bprompt  yeah it now did a search in discover but i think it found not correct package but package of similar text description in it. Your link is apt://speech-dispatcher not apt:speech-dispatcher and it looks like it does a search filling search field and find wrong package of Navi some map navigation or something
[2024-01-04 20:26] <Kangarooo> some Navit app it found
[2024-01-04 20:32] <bprompt> Kangarooo: apt:// is correct, since it's a browser protocol, the rest is just the canonical name in the repository for the app
[2024-01-04 20:33] <bprompt> Kangarooo: I found it in Synaptic, which is what I use for searching apps
[2024-01-04 20:36] <dgutov> Hi all! My gnome-shell has been very crashy (like several times per day) after the upgrade to 23.10, so much that I first switched to the Wayland session (because restarts were more frequent with X11, and session restart is now broken: LP#2040453). The first few days it's been quite stable but today it's crashy again now on Wayland -- though less
[2024-01-04 20:36] <dgutov> so. journalctl shows "segmentation faults", but different ones. The latest included the "unite" extension, but the previous one was some "general protection fault" in libgobject.
[2024-01-04 20:36] <dgutov> If anyone has better suggestions, I'll be thankful for pointers, but I'm currently trying to install debugging symbols for gnome-shell, so at least I could try to file a bug report with a backtrace properly.
[2024-01-04 20:36] <dgutov> I've added 'ddebs.ubuntu.com' to the sources as some advice on the internet says, but apparently it only has gnome-shell-dbgsym for 45.2, whereas gnome-shell in Mantic is 45.1. So I just get "gnome-shell-dbgsym : Depends: gnome-shell (= 45.2-0ubuntu1) but 45.1-0ubuntu1 is to be installed". What am I doing wrong?
[2024-01-04 20:37] <leftyfb> dgutov: I would look in dmesg for potential hardware issues
[2024-01-04 20:41] <tomreyn> could be hardware, or could be buggy gnome-shell extensions (which is probably the main reason gnome-shell would become unstable)
[2024-01-04 20:42] <Kangarooo> pragmaticenigma tomreyn bprompt  i updated bug about apt: vs apt:// with your help https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/plasma-discover/+bug/2048117
[2024-01-04 20:43] <Kangarooo> maybe wiki help about apturl is wrong
[2024-01-04 20:43] <Kangarooo> or something broken
[2024-01-04 20:47] <tomreyn> Kangarooo: so what you don't seem to understand yet is that apt: URIs are not guaranteed to work with every package and every package manager (frontend). you started by making up an apt: URI, which doesn't actually exist anywhere, and then insist on this working for installing a package, and filed a bug report about this theoretical issue.
[2024-01-04 20:48] <tomreyn> Kangarooo: sorry for the rough tone. i do understand you're probably meaning to do good, and help out make software better. that's appreciated.
[2024-01-04 20:48] <Kangarooo> yes, something needs to be fixed for base users to have it easy
[2024-01-04 20:49] <tomreyn> that's an opinion not everyone might be sharing.
[2024-01-04 20:51] <tomreyn> personally, i think it will do most people good to learn their way around the terminal generally. they don't need to become professionals there, but learing a few most common commands can help them make great progress in using their computers. that, too, is, obviously, an opinion.
[2024-01-04 20:52] <Kangarooo> tomreyn some things dont need to be easy? what should be not easy? like installing app shouldnt be as much as easy as possible? if apturl would work as in wiki apt: or apt:// then it would help to keep users on Ubuntu
[2024-01-04 20:52] <Kangarooo> ok
[2024-01-04 20:54] <tomreyn> apart from this i'm not sure why a speedtest web page would require TTS
[2024-01-04 20:54] <pragmaticenigma> tomreyn: It's probably got a accessibility feature somewhere on the page
[2024-01-04 20:55] <tomreyn> yes, probably
[2024-01-04 20:56] <bprompt> Kangarooo: heheh, I'd say I agree with you, the idea of User-Friendly matters hugely, and to that extent as Debian motto has it, it "should just work", just bear in mind that's dependent on distribution, package manager, browser's handlers, and all those factors need the setup, and it'll work fine, most of the time, I think you did lots of good, just bear in mind that sometimes things are "systemic" and there's no a malign intention behind them
[2024-01-04 21:03] <tomreyn> Kangarooo: if you'd like to make a case for having more apt: (or apt://) URIs and better support for them in / around Ubuntu, I think https://community.ubuntu.com is probably a better place, since this channel here (as well as the bugs area on launchpad) is really dedicated to supporting what's already implemented and how things are currently designed.
[2024-01-04 21:04] <tomreyn> but the community is a good place to bring this up and grow new ideas, i would think.
[2024-01-04 21:04] <raxor2k> why does setting up mail using postfix with docker seem like worlds most difficult task?
[2024-01-04 21:04] <Kangarooo> raxor2k: agree, i wasnt able to find enoguht info about that too
[2024-01-04 21:04] <tomreyn> raxor2k: because you have not tried to setup sendmail with docker, yet
[2024-01-04 21:05] <raxor2k> I tried for 3 hours today..
[2024-01-04 21:05] <tomreyn> what exactly doesn't seem to work?
[2024-01-04 21:07] <pragmaticenigma> I'm going to guess that docker may not be the best environment for a mail tranfer server. as there's a lot of things that require non-volitile storage (mailboxes) and statefulness between runs.
[2024-01-04 21:07] <pragmaticenigma> which adds to the complexity of setting everything up
[2024-01-04 21:08] <raxor2k> i just need a simple docker setup that can send noreply emails.. thats all
[2024-01-04 21:11] <tomreyn> we only support ubuntu here, not custom docker images, but there's probably a docker channel where you could seek support with such, or an online database where you could search for it.
[2024-01-04 21:11] <tomreyn> if you'd like to try installing postfix directly on a full / proper ubuntu installation, #ubuntu's a good place.
[2024-01-04 21:12] <pragmaticenigma> raxor2k: I'd follow tomreyn's suggestion. try getting postfix up and running as a package install under Ubuntu to work the kinks out. It might then help to understand what's missing in your desired goal of running in docker.
[2024-01-04 21:13] <raxor2k> i made it up running using docker finally, i just needed to change from port 25(digital ocean blocks it), to another
[2024-01-04 21:13] <raxor2k> But i still get access denied..
[2024-01-04 21:13] <raxor2k> or HTTP timed out
[2024-01-04 21:14] <pragmaticenigma> raxor2k: I would encourage using a digital ocean forum. there's probably someone there that has encountered this before and can help

[2024-01-04 21:25] <tomreyn> "it", not "ist"
[2024-01-04 21:25] <dgutov> tomreyn: I understand the point regarding the extensions, but it's difficult to use gnome without 'unite' and dash-to-dock
[2024-01-04 21:26] <dgutov> Sometimes the crash backtrace ends up in an extension, but not always (and often the backtrace is in the log, but it doesn't lead to a crash)
[2024-01-04 21:26] <tomreyn> a deteriorating physical media structure would explain such 'random' failures
[2024-01-04 21:27] <tomreyn> it's porbably not a siftware issue
[2024-01-04 21:27] <tomreyn> it's prbably not a software issue
[2024-01-04 21:30] <tomreyn> my suspicion is based on the quoted lines 2 to 5 (6 adds to it). line 1 is unrelated. and the drm failures are probably related to an intel gpu, which is either a driver / firmware bug or a side effect of a generally discomposing system
[2024-01-04 21:31] <tomreyn> an easier way to share potential errors from your system log is   journalctl -b -p3 | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-04 21:32] <bprompt> dgutov: I agree with tomreyn, rule out hardware first, since in this case is a suspect, run a SMART check on it, if that's not the case, try running a LIveUSB session, to rule out badRAM, if all that works, then it's software, and maybe entertain a reinstallation
[2024-01-04 21:32] <tomreyn> you could also replace 3 by 4
[2024-01-04 21:32] <leftyfb> dgutov: what release of ubuntu?
[2024-01-04 21:33] <dgutov> tomreyn: Does this look bad? https://pastebin.com/Lp0hSwVu I'm not sure I'm reading it correctly.
[2024-01-04 21:33] <dgutov> It says "No Errors Logged", but the "TYPE" column says "Old-age" or "Pre-fail". I don't understand whether these are descriptions of the current values or the general descriptions of the counters.
[2024-01-04 21:33] <dgutov> leftyfb 23.10, the latest
[2024-01-04 21:35] <pragmaticenigma> dgutov: Old-age/Pre-fail are designators for a device with a lot of operating hours
[2024-01-04 21:36] <dgutov> All right, so this does indicate an aging ssd? nvme actually.
[2024-01-04 21:36] <pragmaticenigma> dgutov: If you paste the output of smart, we might be able to see if anything is specifically troubling about the device
[2024-01-04 21:36] <dgutov> The output of smartctl is in the pastebin above. Should I resend it with termbin instead?
[2024-01-04 21:36] <pragmaticenigma> no... I just didn't see the link that's all
[2024-01-04 21:36] <tomreyn> the TYPE is just printed to explain the meaning of this indicator, not to state a status.
[2024-01-04 21:37] <bprompt> dgutov:  when storage is going south, software will complain in not-so-many-words that it can't store a file or a socket, it can't access an object loaded, it can't open a file and so on, since it's not there to diagnose hardware, you get those errors, however it can't store a file because it maybe onto a bad cluster, or a corrupted area, it can't access an object from ram, because  badRAM already corrupted it and so on
[2024-01-04 21:38] <dgutov> bprompt: Makes sense. I'm not seeing much of errors like this, though. Could be RAM, I suppose...
[2024-01-04 21:39] <leftyfb> dgutov: [42009.459976] device offline error, dev sda, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 0 prio class 2
[2024-01-04 21:39] <leftyfb> that is a storage error
[2024-01-04 21:39] <leftyfb> along with the following 2 messages in your pastebin
[2024-01-04 21:39] <tomreyn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Monitoring,_Analysis_and_Reporting_Technology#Known_ATA_S.M.A.R.T._attributes helps a little with interpreting the smartctl output.
[2024-01-04 21:40] <dgutov> tomreyn: Here's the output with p3: https://termbin.com/1a8g
[2024-01-04 21:40] <leftyfb> you have an issue with your drive
[2024-01-04 21:42] <dgutov> p4 is a lot more verbose, though (with the whole x-session output, etc): https://termbin.com/c2la Apparently it got cut off because of the length.
[2024-01-04 21:43] <dgutov> leftyb: Thank you, I guess I'll try fsck, then rebooting and see whether this error persists. And then backing up and replacing it, I guess.
[2024-01-04 21:43] <dgutov> leftyfb, sorry for the typo
[2024-01-04 21:43] <tomreyn> better create a backup image first of all if you want to keep as much data as possible
[2024-01-04 21:44] <leftyfb> if you don't have a backup, the data wasn't important to begin with :)
[2024-01-04 21:44] <bprompt> hehehe
[2024-01-04 21:45] <pragmaticenigma> that's a fun sentiment until it's when creating the backup that it failed
[2024-01-04 21:46] <dgutov> I have *some* backups ;-D It's been a long time since I tried restoring from them. And they are not for the whole disk.
[2024-01-04 21:46] <bprompt> dgutov: though along the same lines as tomreyn, using a LiveUSB session, you'd want to see if you can pull out of there /home and all its profiles, is where all configurations are, and as you'd know, configuring packages can take between 4hours or 20hours, so not having to redo that would help
[2024-01-04 21:47] <dgutov> pragmaticenigma I guess one should have multi-point backups. Where to get all that free storage, though ;-/
[2024-01-04 21:48] <causative> how is Wayland supposedly better? so far all I am seeing is that x11vnc no longer works, and when I connected to gnome vnc desktop sharing, my shift key got screwed up somehow and I can't restart wayland to fix it like I could under x11
[2024-01-04 21:48] <tomreyn> my point about taking an image: repairing file systems should be attempted on reliable physical media only. and writes to detieriorating physical media should be limited as much as possible to increase chances to gather correct cpies of the data stored on them before they may ultimatively fail.
[2024-01-04 21:48] <bprompt> dgutov: come on dude, I just got a 512Gbs usb-stick :)
[2024-01-04 21:49] <dgutov> bprompt: Thanks! I guess my current problem is that things mostly work, and well. Aside from the odd crashes. Disk reads are fast enough, and so on. But the laptop is 5 years old, so this should have been expected.
[2024-01-04 21:49] <leftyfb> until they don't
[2024-01-04 21:49] <pragmaticenigma> causative: do you have a support question for us to help with? if you just want to speak grievences, please join us in #ubuntu-offtopic
[2024-01-04 21:50] <dgutov> bprompt: Well, to backup my current disk I'll need a 1Tb+ usb-stick. And for a multi-tiered backup session, several :)
[2024-01-04 21:50] <causative> alright yes I have a support question: my left shift key has stopped working after using gnome vnc desktop sharing. How can I get it to start working again without rebooting the computer?
[2024-01-04 21:51] <dgutov> Anyway, thank you everybody :thumbsup:
[2024-01-04 21:51] <pragmaticenigma> causative: I'd start with killing the x11vnc service/process. that's usually resolved stuck keys for me
[2024-01-04 21:51] <causative> x11vnc is not running
[2024-01-04 21:51] <causative> it's gnome vnc desktop sharing
[2024-01-04 21:51] <causative> from the settings, under desktop sharing
[2024-01-04 21:51] <leftyfb> Every other night all my machines are backed up to my NAS and the next night to an encrypted offsite storage just using rsync. The NAS is encrypted and backed up to Cloud storage every night. Then once a year I backup the most recent backups to an encrypted drive stored in a fireproof safe
[2024-01-04 21:51] <bprompt> dgutov: well, I can tell you my story with an OCZ SSD brand new I put in my machine a long time ago, it was working smoking fast, machine went about 10 times swooping through, about hmmm was a year, not even I think 6 months, one day I shutdown at 5pm, next day I clicked the Power button at 9 maybe 10em, Pooof!!!, but I always back up, so I lost nothing, went ahead and got a Samsung SSD :)
[2024-01-04 21:52] <pragmaticenigma> causative: do you have sticky keys enabled?
[2024-01-04 21:52] <bprompt> dgutov: so pretty much as leftyfb said, it works till it doesn't :)
[2024-01-04 21:52] <causative> I just turned gnome vnc desktop sharing off and on, no change, left shift key still not working
[2024-01-04 21:52] <causative> I don't see a setting for sticky keys
[2024-01-04 21:53] <bprompt> dgutov:  btw on the OCZ SSD failure, I never got any SMART warnings or software errors, it just went poof
[2024-01-04 21:53] <leftyfb> causative: x11vnc doesn't work on wayland, the reason is in the name of the program
[2024-01-04 21:53] <causative> <causative> x11vnc is not running <causative> it's gnome vnc desktop sharing
[2024-01-04 21:53] <causative> <causative> from the settings, under desktop sharing
[2024-01-04 21:53] <leftyfb> causative: please don't repeat
[2024-01-04 21:54] <leftyfb> I was just responding to " so far all I am seeing is that x11vnc no longer works"
[2024-01-04 21:55] <causative> my current problem is that the left shift key is not working and I want to fix this without rebooting the computer
[2024-01-04 21:56] <causative> previously the left shift key was stuck ON, which I resolved by opening the on-screen keyboard and pressing it there, but now it is stuck off
[2024-01-04 21:56] <leftyfb> causative: rebooting would be the only definitive way you determine it isn't a hardware problem
[2024-01-04 21:56] <causative> it is not a hardware problem, it happened immediately after using VNC
[2024-01-04 21:56] <leftyfb> causative: CTRL+ALT+F1   try your left shift key there
[2024-01-04 21:56] <dgutov> bprompt: Thanks for the warning, I guess it works like that
[2024-01-04 21:57] <causative> it works fine there leftyfb
[2024-01-04 21:57] <leftyfb> causative: ok, then log out of your gnome session and back in and it should be fixed
[2024-01-04 21:57] <causative> I don't want to log out if at all avoidable, I would have to close a lot of things
[2024-01-04 21:57] <dgutov> BTW, folks, I've been a special kind of stupid for the last 10 minutes at least: my /dev/sda is the external drive. Even if it were failing, that's not much of a problem.
[2024-01-04 21:58] <causative> prior to wayland I was able to solve this type of problem with alt+f2, r but this doesn't work under wayland, is there any alternative to reset keybd configuration?
[2024-01-04 21:58] <leftyfb> dgutov: unplug it for a while and see if the problems go away
[2024-01-04 21:59] <dgutov> Hmmmm
[2024-01-04 21:59] <dgutov> Will try that
[2024-01-04 21:59] <bprompt> dgutov: the unplugging as leftyfb works when you have static electricity in the device, and that happens more than you think
[2024-01-04 22:00] <dgutov> It doesn't have a separate power source, though. It's just a case feeding from the same USB cable that connects it to the laptop.
[2024-01-04 22:01] <dgutov> But already unplugged, will observe
[2024-01-04 22:01] <pragmaticenigma> causative: from everything I'm reading... VNC isn't supported by Wayland. How you got it working in the first place is a bit of a mystery. I don't see any other options beyond a reboot, and discontinuing the usage of VNC when in a Wayland session.
[2024-01-04 22:01] <bprompt> dgutov: the static occurs mostly on the plug, for devices btw
[2024-01-04 22:02] <causative> pragmaticenigma, go to gnome settings -> sharing -> remote desktop -> check the "enable legacy vnc protocol" box
[2024-01-04 22:02] <dgutov> Anyway, for completeness here's my smartctl output for the nvme: https://termbin.com/7q9w
[2024-01-04 22:02] <dgutov> bprompt: Noted, thanks
[2024-01-04 22:02] <pragmaticenigma> causative: It's removed in newer versions of Ubuntu. I don't have that feature
[2024-01-04 22:03] <causative> what version are you on?
[2024-01-04 22:03] <causative> I am on 22.04
[2024-01-04 22:05] <leftyfb> causative: I'm pretty sure legavy VNC isn't going to work with wayland
[2024-01-04 22:05] <leftyfb> legacy*
[2024-01-04 22:05] <causative> the option is in the gnome settings for 22.04 LTS so it ought to work
[2024-01-04 22:05] <leftyfb> !bug | causative
[2024-01-04 22:05] <ubottu> causative: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its official !flavors, please report it using the command Â« ubuntu-bug <package> Â» - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[2024-01-04 22:06] <causative> what package would this be a bug in?
[2024-01-04 22:06] <leftyfb> causative: either use not legacy (pretty sure it's RDP) or revert to xorg instead of wayland
[2024-01-04 22:06] <leftyfb> causative: gnome-desktop
[2024-01-04 22:09] <tomreyn> dgutov: i've not seen any issues with the nvme. your conventional magnetic recording external (usb connected) small factor (laptop) hdd is likely failing, though. you have file systems mounted from it so this could causes problems like slowdowns and freezes. you should not see software errors unless software is running from there. there is some other issue with the coexistence of your internal intel gpu and the nvidia dgpu (GeForce GTX 1050 Ti,
[2024-01-04 22:09] <tomreyn> VideoBIOS: 86.07.63.00.6d) which *may* just be a result of outdated bios / video card firmware. i'm trying to stay away from debugging nvidia issues.
[2024-01-04 22:10] <tomreyn> dgutov: look for a bios update for your system, though,    journalctl -b | grep DMI:    will tell what you have now
[2024-01-04 22:13] <tomreyn> leftyfb / causative: gnome in current ubuntu releases provides rdp desktop sharing by default (though disabled by default) and VNC as a legacy options. this can be setup from "Settings" or using the grdctl CLI.
[2024-01-04 22:13] <tomreyn> i also expect VNC not to work well with wayland
[2024-01-04 22:13] <leftyfb> tomreyn: or at all
[2024-01-04 22:13] <tomreyn> or at all :)
[2024-01-04 22:14] <leftyfb> so the bug would be, if running wayland, the option to enable legacy vnc probably shouldn't be available
[2024-01-04 22:14] <pragmaticenigma> I vote at all... as there is a project "wayvnc" but it's early stages, I wouldn't expect it to be in Ubuntu without manually installing it
[2024-01-04 22:15] <tomreyn> rdp works well enough
[2024-01-04 22:16] <causative> I would use rdp except I couldn't find a good android phone client for it when I looked into it some time ago
[2024-01-04 22:16] <causative> they all had some technical issue or another
[2024-01-04 22:16] <causative> or required you to sign in to their "service"
[2024-01-04 22:17] <tomreyn> maybe try one from fdroid.
[2024-01-04 22:19] <pragmaticenigma> causative: this looks promising: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.freerdp.afreerdp/
[2024-01-04 22:25] <tomreyn> dgutov: the "evict_inodes" messages you have on your log may actually be related to ubuntu kernel bug 2037214
[2024-01-04 22:30] <causative> well, there's aFreeRDP from F-droid, which works... except touch to click doesn't work
[2024-01-04 22:34] <causative> ok, no, aFreeRDP is hilariously broken
[2024-01-04 22:36] <pragmaticenigma> causative: it was only a suggestion
[2024-01-04 22:36] <causative> the mouse input totally doesn't work, and the icing on the cake is that the android "back" button sends a signal to hard-close the current ubuntu application
[2024-01-04 22:37] <causative> lost my emacs session as a result
[2024-01-04 22:37] <tomreyn> there's #android, maybe they can help
[2024-01-04 22:42] <dgutov> tomreyn Thanks, looks like my BIOS is the latest available (according to fwupdmgr anyway; version 1.31.0). The nvidia card is indeed there, but in the "on-demand" mode -- the Intel one is supposed to be driving the desktop normally. Though I suppose the proprietary drivers might add their part to the instability of it all. And no, no software is
[2024-01-04 22:42] <dgutov> running from the external drive.
[2024-01-04 22:42] <dgutov> Thanks for the pointer to the LP bug, I've subscribed. I don't have many "evict_inodes" messages, though, so they seem to be mostly harmless in my case.
[2024-01-04 22:44] <tomreyn> dgutov: you did on the latest log you shared
[2024-01-04 22:48] <dgutov> tomreyn: About 25 messages for the last 3 days. As I understand, somebody in the comments has these messages clogging the log ("gigabytes of messages") and bringing down 4 CPUs with that.
[2024-01-04 22:48] <tomreyn> dgutov: i think these will be gone if you either disconnect the usb connected storage or use a different kernel, though.
[2024-01-04 22:48] <dgutov> Yup, I'll see after the next reboot
[2024-01-04 22:49] <dgutov> But indeed, the last such message was 50 minutes ago
[2024-01-04 22:51] <tomreyn> it *may* explain the sda offline error, too.
[2024-01-04 22:53] <dgutov> The kernel bug?
[2024-01-04 22:55] <tomreyn> "device offline error, dev sda, sector 0 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 0 prio class 2" and "Buffer I/O error on dev sda1, logical block 121667584, lost sync page write" and "JBD2: I/O error when updating journal superblock for sda1-8." *may* be follow-up errors
[2024-01-04 22:55] <tomreyn> after all, all of these refer to sda, the usb connected external hdd
[2024-01-04 22:56] <tomreyn> still, the intel gpu errors (atomic update failure on grpahics pipe) are most likely unrelated to this and something which needs solving seperately to stabilize your graphical desktop.
[2024-01-04 22:57] <tomreyn> a "[drm] *ERROR* CPU pipe B FIFO underrun" would likely cause a stalling screen, possibly worse
[2024-01-04 23:03] <dgutov> "FIFO underrun" features only once (for the last 3 days), but indeed there are a lot of "Atomic update failure on pipe B". My screen is not flickering or anything though (when the system is not crashing), and I'm not sure how to proceed with these. Googling either reveals old bug reports (from various years) which were usually closed automatically
[2024-01-04 23:03] <dgutov> due to obsoletion, or recipes for grub to add kernel parameters that disable things (either disabling PSR, or setting max_cstate to 4).
[2024-01-04 23:06] <tomreyn> i'd try a different kernel and disconnected usb hdd (possibly disconnected usb hubs, too, if any) first of all, then see whether those are still occurring.
[2024-01-04 23:07] <tomreyn> what does "the system is crashing" mean exactly?
[2024-01-04 23:08] <G22> Hello, I'm using Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS on a Lenovo Thinkpad P1 Gen 4 20Y3. I'm having some slight WiFi issues and trying to figure out the root cause.
[2024-01-04 23:08] <G22> For a WiFi card, it looks like I've got a Intel Corporation Wi-Fi 6 AX210 160MHz, Kernel driver and module in use: iwlwifi
[2024-01-04 23:08] <G22> The issue I'm having is sometimes for a few seconds or a minute I'll be unable to do anything on the internet. Ex: refresh or visit a new webpage, ping 8.8.8.8 via terminal etc. If I disconnect from Wifi and then reconnect it works immediately.
[2024-01-04 23:08] <dgutov> tomreyn One of today's examples:
[2024-01-04 23:08] <G22> Sometimes it happens while I'm actively using the laptop, sometimes it happens if it's been sitting in suspend for awhile.
[2024-01-04 23:08] <dgutov> Jan 04 19:52:29 potemkin kernel: traps: gnome-shell[139060] general protection fault ip:7f5b8b546ba8 sp:7ffeda6f8928 error:0 in libgobject-2.0.so.0.7800.0[7f5b8b51b000+34000]
[2024-01-04 23:08] <G22> If anyone has any ideas of info I should collect, please let me know. Thanks!
[2024-01-04 23:08] <dgutov> The session dies and logs me out. This happened while I was afk, iirc.
[2024-01-04 23:10] <tomreyn> dgutov: i see. and you have multiple of these? this could be anything from a hardware error (possibly bad ram module) to a broken gnome-shell extension really.
[2024-01-04 23:16] <tomreyn> dgutov: you mentioned two gnome-shell extensions. one was dash-to-dock - i don't expect this to cause problems since it is used by many and well tested. the other was "unite", which i do not know ( https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1287/unite/ has a comment saying the versions published on extensions.gnome.org  are incompatible with gnome-shell 45).
[2024-01-04 23:18] <dgutov> tomreyn: I'd rather want to object that any extension written in a managed language shouldn't be able to crash the system, but I guess that's where we are. Anyway, I get backtraces that don't look exactly the same. The more latest one was with an extension's code in the backtrace (already reported to the author a week ago, it happened the second
[2024-01-04 23:18] <dgutov> time today under the same circumstances: https://github.com/hardpixel/unite-shell/issues/360).
[2024-01-04 23:19] <dgutov> As you can see, Unite is pretty popular as well (although less so, by about 4x). It has a version for gnome 45 published in "releases" because the author reportedly is having trouble with EGO's review process.
[2024-01-04 23:20] <tomreyn> dgutov: you stated "My gnome-shell has been very crashy (like several times per day) after the upgrade to 23.10" and 23.10 uses gnome-shell version 45. i agree about an extension written in a managed language should not be able to cause a critical malfunction to its interpreter. but that's just your and my opinion, not neccessarily the reality.
[2024-01-04 23:20] <dgutov> The drama is described there: https://github.com/hardpixel/unite-shell/issues/339#issuecomment-1764399267
[2024-01-04 23:21] <dgutov> tomreyn: It's an objective technical opinion, but indeed I understand that gnome is not up to our expectations in terms of stability.
[2024-01-04 23:23] <tomreyn> well, i would try running without this extension for a while, if that is acceptable to you.
[2024-01-04 23:23] <tomreyn> just to see whether it helps with stability
[2024-01-04 23:23] <dgutov> I can try, but I'd probably have to switch away from gnome if it indeed turns out to be the problem
[2024-01-04 23:25] <tomreyn> unmodified gnome-shell is rather stable *nowadays* (and for a while now), despite all the warnings it spews constantly.
[2024-01-04 23:25] <dgutov> On that note - back to my original question. When I do get a weird backtrace from gnome, even if it's caused by an extension, it should be a reportable situation, right? At least if the backtrace was radable enough. So is there a recommended way to install debugging symbols for gnome-shell 45.1?
[2024-01-04 23:25] <dgutov> Stable yes, usable - matter of opinion. I really miss Unity, I guess.
[2024-01-04 23:26] <tomreyn> you can switch to unity if you like
[2024-01-04 23:26] <tomreyn> i'm not sure about why the debug symbols package version differs from the header-less one, as you say
[2024-01-04 23:27] <dgutov> IIUC Unity is not as well-maintained these days. Though somebody tries. And there's likely no hope for Wayland support, etc.
[2024-01-04 23:28] <dgutov> Perhaps I've enabled the wrong repository? Is this correct?
[2024-01-04 23:28] <dgutov> deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com mantic main restricted universe multiverse
[2024-01-04 23:28] <dgutov> deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com mantic-updates main restricted universe multiverse
[2024-01-04 23:28] <dgutov> deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com mantic-proposed main restricted universe multiverse
[2024-01-04 23:28] <tomreyn> maybe -proposed is the issue there
[2024-01-04 23:29] <tomreyn> potentially giving you newer versions than the stable ones which symbols are available for
[2024-01-04 23:30] <tomreyn> (and possibly introducing more instability than a non LTS already can do)
[2024-01-04 23:32] <dgutov> Oh. Thanks.
[2024-01-04 23:33] <causative> aRDP Free works great though, once I figured out I can manually set the resolution in the settings for it, since that wasn't working
[2024-01-04 23:33] <dgutov> g22: I think I've had a problem like that at some point which was related to the power management of the wi-fi card
[2024-01-04 23:33] <causative> aFreeRDP is very misleadingly named, probably so people would confuse it with aRDP Free
[2024-01-04 23:33] <dgutov> Perhaps this would help: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1294591/how-to-permanently-set-wi-fi-power-management-flag-to-off
[2024-01-04 23:34] <tomreyn> g22 already left unfortunately
[2024-01-04 23:34] <jeremy31> dgutov: I think the wifi power save issue was figured out in 2017
[2024-01-04 23:36] <dgutov> IIRC I've had that with this very same laptop, which was manufactured in 2018. And see the dates of the question and the answer I linked.
[2024-01-04 23:36] <dgutov> tomreyn: That's too bad
[2024-01-04 23:37] <dgutov> Removing "proposed" really helped, thanks
[2024-01-04 23:39] <tomreyn> nice
[2024-01-04 23:42] <jeremy31> dgutov: This is what started the wifi power save issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1557026
[2024-01-04 23:45] <dgutov> jeremy31: Makes sense that fixing that triggered some problems. These days wifi.powersave is set to 3, including here. But it seems like if a particular driver got powersaving enabled while it didn't work very well, you could have "hanging" wi-fi until network-manager is restarted. I've battled with such for a while.
[2024-01-05 00:47] <loswedseded> do you have your own AI in this channel?
[2024-01-05 00:50] <arraybolt3> No, though there's a factoid bot.
[2024-01-05 00:51] <arraybolt3> !ubottu
[2024-01-05 00:51] <ubottu> Hi! I'm #ubuntu's favorite infobot. You can search my brain at https://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi | General info and channels at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Bots | Make a clone of me, see !botclone
[2024-01-05 00:56] <loswedseded> !ubottu, can you hear me?
[2024-01-05 00:56] <ubottu> loswedseded: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[2024-01-05 00:56] <loswedseded> !ubottu, when will 24.04 be released?
[2024-01-05 00:58] <arraybolt3> You can direct message the bot to experiment with it without causing spam.
[2024-01-05 01:01] <leftyfb> loswedseded: 24.04 will be released in April
[2024-01-05 01:36] <dgutov> Well, it didn't last long: I got a crash again with a bracktrace I've seen previously: https://pastebin.com/cB1csEV2
[2024-01-05 01:36] <dgutov> Googling shows previous reports shows pages like https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1836090 which went nowhere.
[2024-01-05 01:36] <dgutov> But what do you know, "minimize.svg" (the only useful constant findable in the backtrace) does get referenced in many files inside ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/unite@hardpixel.eu/themes/ (there are many themes in there which all use this filename).
[2024-01-05 01:37] <dgutov> I wonder where apport sent my crash info -- it apparently did, but I can't find any corresponding bug on launchpad. Perhaps I should report to gnome-shell directly.
[2024-01-05 01:39] <sarnold> try this:
[2024-01-05 01:39] <sarnold> xdg-open https://errors.ubuntu.com/user/`sudo cat /var/lib/whoopsie/whoopsie-id`
[2024-01-05 01:46] <dgutov> sarnold: Thanks! I got this: https://errors.ubuntu.com/user/e941f0eddf365fe3fc22dc2de28329c4ac207d5a2f44dc1882ddc0fd47dc985420ee38c216133b5a658351cb00842cecb739f6abe111b82cffe3f8a9c7a98991
[2024-01-05 01:46] <dgutov> This indeed look like my log of crashes, but I'm not able to view the contents of each individual one because "Sorry, you are not a member of a group that is allowed ..."
[2024-01-05 01:47] <dgutov> Any chance you *are* a member of that group and can see any actual bug report(s) that got filed as a result? I'm not sure requesting access to see everybody's reports is the best course of action for me personally
[2024-01-05 01:51] <sarnold> hrm, this thing doesn't make it easy to walk from the bug reports to the error bucket that they got put in :(
[2024-01-05 02:13] <dgutov> Oh well. Thanks for trying. I reported that to gnome-shell in the meantime, let's see how they react.
[2024-01-05 02:13] <sarnold> dgutov: yeah, I can't find anything that looks quite like yours :(
[2024-01-05 02:13] <sarnold> dgutov: maybe move your extensions out of the way for a bit and see if that helps? it's weird that you've had a year without crashes, and last january, gnome-shell crashes..
[2024-01-05 02:14] <dgutov> I've upgraded to GNOME 45.1
[2024-01-05 02:14] <sarnold> try this on the extensions: cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/ ; mv extensions extensions.old
[2024-01-05 02:15] <dgutov> I'm not sure if I was without crashes, to be honest. But in the past, gnome-shell restarted safely, more or less, keeping applications running (the Xorg session). With a recent bug in GNOME 45.1 it just crashes on an attempt to restart, so I switches to wayland. That helped for a few days, but not too much.
[2024-01-05 02:17] <dgutov> The backtrace mentions a file name which belongs to an extension (and is referenced inside .css file in it). So it's *probably* related, but it hardly seems like the extension's fault.
[2024-01-05 02:21] <sarnold> dgutov: the new gnome-shell design gives extensions a crazy amount of power -- crashes from them are pretty common :(
[2024-01-05 02:28] <tomreyn> dgutov: you could try something along the lines of    gdb -q -n -ex 'continue' $(which gnome-shell) $(pidof gnome-shell)
[2024-01-05 02:28] <tomreyn> but you'd need to do this from an ssh session you can control from another computer, so that you can still analyze the process once it crashes. or at least from a tty
[2024-01-05 02:29] <tomreyn> you could do a 'bt full' in there once it does.
[2024-01-05 02:31] <tomreyn> or, possibly easier, have the core file written elsewhere than the apport pipe it normally goes to, but on disk, and then analyze the core file later one.
[2024-01-05 02:31] <sarnold> heh, gdb gives me that same reaction, too!
[2024-01-05 02:31] <tomreyn> looks like gnome-shell crashed
[2024-01-05 02:32] <dgutov> Well, that made my current gnome-shell session freeze XD
[2024-01-05 02:32] <tomreyn> hmm sorry, the "continue" should have made it continue, not sure why it wouldn't
[2024-01-05 02:33] <tomreyn> you can always type that out on the gdb prompt, as long as you can type something there
[2024-01-05 02:34] <tomreyn> (other computer, ssh)
[2024-01-05 02:34] <dgutov> Anyway, 'apport -g' turns a .crash file into a gdb session rather successfully. That's where I got the stack trace from.
[2024-01-05 02:34] <dgutov> Sorry, 'apport-retrace -g'
[2024-01-05 02:35] <tomreyn> ah that's possibly the better way.
[2024-01-05 02:37] <dgutov> Ok, so you're suggesting to attach gdb waiting for the next crash? That sounds like a fine approach, maybe I'll do that if the gnome folks really decide to investigate and ask for some more information.
[2024-01-05 02:37] <tomreyn> yes, this was my plan
[2024-01-05 02:47] <dgutov> Hmm, LP#1788429 has a very similar backtrace. But it's 3.5 years old and apparently "fixed".
[2024-01-05 02:51] <sarnold> dgutov: that certainly looks like it spends enough time in libst to match yours, even if the 'earlier' paths are pretty different -- but the error tracker's most recent entry there is from Wednesday, August 17, 2022 09:32 UTC
[2024-01-05 02:52] <dgutov> Yup. And its related gnome-shell issue has a committed fix (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/2757)
[2024-01-05 02:56] <sarnold> nice
[2024-01-05 06:56] <poweruser__> irc.openjoke.org
[2024-01-05 07:42] <Yakov84> When i use search in folder GUI filed for it, it freezes and says Files not responding
[2024-01-05 08:15] <en1gma> im running ubuntu 22.04.3 lts amd64-desktop. im trying to use nautilus browser to ssh into another device to the / location. it puts me in home and i can not go higher up a level. i can do it with terminal and ssh. why cant i with nautilus
[2024-01-05 08:19] <ravage> https://p.haxxors.com/mwnlsb7z.webm
[2024-01-05 08:28] <en1gma> 'mc' lets me do it
[2024-01-05 08:29] <en1gma> cool. i love mc anyway
[2024-01-05 08:48] <olle> Did something weird happen with firefox on ubuntu last week(s)? It's eating my cpu for breakfast right now.
[2024-01-05 08:48] <olle> Using Xubuntu 20.04 LTS
[2024-01-05 08:48] <olle> Or Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
[2024-01-05 08:49] <olle> Or maybe some video encoding/decoding driver has failed recently
[2024-01-05 10:43] <manwhowouldbekin> Hi all! While troubleshooting issues with a file syncing app, I was led to check the version of OpenSSL installed on my Ubuntu. I found this https://pastebin.com/ayzJbikY That is, the version that is used by default on my system is that provided by Anaconda/Miniconda. How can I change that? Is there a way to do it via Anaconda itself? That is, if I could upgrade from 1.x.x to something like 2.x.x there, it would
[2024-01-05 10:43] <manwhowouldbekin> probably work for me.
[2024-01-05 12:44] <Kronos> Hi
[2024-01-05 12:45] <Kronos> Does UncomplicatedFirewall use nftables?
[2024-01-05 12:46] <Kronosphere> Hi. Does UncomplicatedFirewall use nftables?
[2024-01-05 12:49] <ravage> there is only nftables
[2024-01-05 12:49] <ravage> everything else is a wrapper
[2024-01-05 12:53] <Kronosphere> Ok, my understanding is ufw uses iptables
[2024-01-05 12:54] <Kronosphere> ufw's man page talks of iptables, but not nftables.
[2024-01-05 13:06] <Kronosphere> hmmmmmmmm
[2024-01-05 13:14] <hygl> I have got two dell latitude 5491 running 22.04/23.10 . On both, when I connect the power supply, they do not charge immateriality, but it takes half an hour or longer before they change from 'not charging' to 'charging'. Is there an option, that they start charging right after connected to the power supply?
[2024-01-05 13:29] <pagios>  hi all, if i have file1.7z.001 file2.7z.002 etc, how can i extract them ?
[2024-01-05 13:37] <sc6502> pagios, do you have 7z installed?
[2024-01-05 13:59] <Lcawte> I'm getting a lot of complaints about cgroups (not existing) in my server logs from systemd/systemctl. Any idea where I start
[2024-01-05 14:00] <Lcawte> I suspect it's somewhat related that SSHd won't start (sshd -t complains about missing priv seperation)
[2024-01-05 14:04] <leftyfb> Lcawte: you have to be leaving out some critical details. What release of ubuntu? How exactly did you install it? What sort of hardware/hypervisor/container is it installed on? What types of really deep customizations have you made that would cause these sorts of issues?
[2024-01-05 14:05] <leftyfb> Lcawte: A default install of ubuntu server onto an x86 or even arm device can install sshd and will not have any of the issues you described
[2024-01-05 14:28] <Enissay> Hmm, I just noticed I have a couple movies on my NAS with creation dates in the future `-rwxrwxrwx 1 eny eny  16G Jan  1  2098 Nice.Movie.REMASTERED.1080p.BluRay.x264-GAZER.mkv
[2024-01-05 14:30] <leftyfb> Enissay: I don't see how this relates to Ubuntu. Any number of things could have happened or is still happening on an almost infinite number of OS's
[2024-01-05 14:31] <Enissay> I was just curious how that can occur to avoid it... Only a couple files had such thing out of many... I updated that manually anyway, so, just for info xD
[2024-01-05 14:36] <Lcawte> leftyfb: Yes, my apologies. Was 20.04 on a dedicated box, 64bit. Wasn't an issue at boot (as far as I could tell, provider rebooted post PSU replacement) - not really any specific customizations, one additional cgroup directory. Rebooted and it's playing nice so far.
[2024-01-05 14:42] <dgutov> In continuation of yesterday's chat, what if gnome crashes, with an entry like this:
[2024-01-05 14:42] <dgutov> Jan 05 14:16:27 potemkin gnome-shell[3533]: #0Â Â  555bb20aa9d8 iÂ Â  resource:///org/gnome/shell/ui/init.js:21 (3d2e25e70ba0 @ 48)

[2024-01-05 14:42] <dgutov> Jan 05 14:16:27 potemkin gnome-shell[3533]: GNOME Shell crashed with signal 11
[2024-01-05 14:42] <dgutov> ...but there is nothing else in the journal, and apport doesn't pick up the crash log? Is that a problem to look into further?
[2024-01-05 14:43] <leftyfb> !paste | dgutov
[2024-01-05 14:43] <ubottu> dgutov: For posting multi-line texts into the channel, please use https://dpaste.com | To post !screenshots use https://imgur.com | !pastebinit to paste directly from command line | Make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic.
[2024-01-05 14:44] <dgutov> Here's a fuller excerpt: https://dpaste.com/DYBA5XEGH But there are just 3 important lines here, and anywhere, that I could find.
[2024-01-05 14:45] <dgutov> I'm guessing it's again related to the external hdd's problems (either the disk itself, or the enclosure), but it's odd that the crash is not recorder, nor is it sent for collection. This might affect many others, and we wouldn't know.
[2024-01-05 14:53] <Solarium> Good Day everyone, I need some help tracking down why my WiFi is intermittently just freezing up. Sometimes it happens on a long suspend, sometimes it happens if the laptop is sitting there, sometimes while I'm actually using it.
[2024-01-05 14:53] <Solarium> I'm using Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS on a Thinkpad P1 Gen 4. The Wifi card seems to be a Intel AX210 using the kernel driver iwlwifi. Is there perhaps proprietary intel drivers I need to get? I was looking around and couldn't find any, maybe I missed it.
[2024-01-05 14:53] <Solarium> If anyone could help I'd appreciate it
[2024-01-05 14:54] <leftyfb> Solarium: start by disabling wifi power save
[2024-01-05 14:55] <Solarium> leftyfb Sure, I'll lookup how to do that, thanks. Does that mean that when the laptop is suspended, it won't power off the wifi card too? or only during operation. I appreciate it
[2024-01-05 14:55] <leftyfb> no
[2024-01-05 14:56] <Solarium> Ah ok thanks
[2024-01-05 14:56] <leftyfb> power save has little to do with suspending the laptop
[2024-01-05 14:56] <leftyfb> though suspend on all computers in general is a whole other set of problems. I tend to stay clear of that
[2024-01-05 14:57] <Solarium> got you
[2024-01-05 14:57] <Solarium> $ cat /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/*.conf
[2024-01-05 14:57] <Solarium> [connection]
[2024-01-05 14:57] <Solarium> wifi.powersave = 3
[2024-01-05 14:57] <Solarium> I'll need to find what value to change that to I'm guessing
[2024-01-05 14:57] <leftyfb> 2
[2024-01-05 14:57] <Solarium> Ah ok, Thanks!
[2024-01-05 14:59] <jeremy31> Solarium: also check results for iwconfig
[2024-01-05 15:00] <Solarium> What specifically would I be looking for using iwconfig? link quality and retry short limit or something?
[2024-01-05 15:00] <leftyfb> "Power MAnagement"
[2024-01-05 15:00] <Solarium> It's set to on
[2024-01-05 15:00] <leftyfb> A/a
[2024-01-05 15:01] <leftyfb> chabnge your setting, reboot and see what it's set to
[2024-01-05 15:01] <Solarium> Will do, Thanks a lot
[2024-01-05 15:01] <Solarium> I'll change it and see if it happens more, If I'm not back have a great weekend!
[2024-01-05 17:09] <dgutov> So... I set up a breakpoint with gdb in a VT (at Alt-F4), and when gnome-shell crashed this time, gdb aborted as well. No chance to print the backtrace or do anything: https://imgur.com/a/5G8Wnye (the "show logging" command is something I typed before the breakpoint was hit).
[2024-01-05 17:09] <dgutov> Is that another symptom of faulty memory, or a misconfigured system? The external drive was disconnected this time.
[2024-01-05 17:16] <leftyfb> dgutov: do you still have the defective drive plugged in?
[2024-01-05 17:16] <dgutov> Unplugged since before the last crash (mentioned above)
[2024-01-05 17:16] <leftyfb> dgutov: and do you have non-stock gnome extensions removed?
[2024-01-05 17:22] <dgutov> No, those are still around. I'm trying to learn to produce useful backtraces for gnome-shell that would help fix any incompatibilities.
[2024-01-05 17:23] <leftyfb> dgutov: step #1: find out what is causing the issue   step #2  report it as a bug   step #1.5 or #3 spend time trying to capture backtraces and dig into why thr cause is causing problems
[2024-01-05 17:24] <leftyfb> the easiest method in this case would be to remove all added gnome extensions and see if the problem goes away. Then add them back in 1 at a time until the problem can be replicated
[2024-01-05 17:24] <leftyfb> process of elimination
[2024-01-05 17:24] <leftyfb> once you have your culprit, you can spend time looking further into the issue
[2024-01-05 17:27] <dgutov> I only have ~3 non-trivial extensions, and one of them is Ubuntu's built-in (Indicators). The problem does not happen predictably, so eliminating the causes might take a while
[2024-01-05 17:27] <dgutov> I tried to capture the backtrace - and it didn't work at all (gdb died on gnome-shell's sigsegv)
[2024-01-05 17:29] <leftyfb> dgutov: you're already spending lots of time chasing cryptic messages. You can do both at the same time. Remove the non-stock extensions
[2024-01-05 17:34] <Yakov> Pls guide me how to kill terminal 4241
[2024-01-05 17:34] <Yakov> https://justpaste.it/9wikd
[2024-01-05 17:35] <leftyfb> Yakov: do you mean PID 4241?
[2024-01-05 17:35] <Yakov> yes
[2024-01-05 17:35] <Yakov> tried kill, kill -9, pkill
[2024-01-05 17:35] <leftyfb> reboot
[2024-01-05 17:36] <Yakov> lol
[2024-01-05 17:36] <arraybolt3> if `kill -9 4241` doesn't work, it's probably stuck on a syscall.
[2024-01-05 17:36] <Yakov> cant reboot
[2024-01-05 17:36] <arraybolt3> you can try `sudo kill -9 4241` as a last-ditch effort
[2024-01-05 17:36] <arraybolt3> that's the ultimate sledgehammer, if that doesn't work you're out of options except to wait.
[2024-01-05 17:37] <leftyfb> as I said, reboot :)
[2024-01-05 17:37] <Yakov> case: I have a lot of gnome-terminal instances opened, I need to close all, exept one, thats why I need to kill
[2024-01-05 17:37] <leftyfb> reboot or ignore it
[2024-01-05 17:37] <Yakov> process is killed with sudo
[2024-01-05 17:37] <Yakov> but still there are two terminals opened
[2024-01-05 17:41] <dgutov> leftyfb: The difference is I'll be working in a less functional environment during that time. And reproduction might take a while: last time, the "good" period lasted several days, even with the extensions enabled.
[2024-01-05 17:41] <dgutov> Anyway, switched them off now. I'll see what happens.
[2024-01-05 17:45] <Yakov> guys, any suggestions upon my case?
[2024-01-05 17:46] <leftyfb> Yakov: reboot or ignore it. Those are your only 2 options
[2024-01-05 17:46] <Yakov> I need to do it every day
[2024-01-05 17:46] <leftyfb> then you're doing something very wrong
[2024-01-05 17:47] <Yakov> I have one app which is static, other secondary apps call their terminals which I need to kill
[2024-01-05 17:47] <leftyfb> define "app" that "call their terminals"
[2024-01-05 17:47] <Yakov> so I need to kill all terminal, excluding GUI and one terminal to do OS commands
[2024-01-05 17:47] <Yakov> c++ application
[2024-01-05 17:48] <leftyfb> custom?
[2024-01-05 17:48] <Yakov> my app
[2024-01-05 17:48] <leftyfb> ok, fix the bug causing the problem
[2024-01-05 17:48] <leftyfb> it's making a syscall that is hanging forever
[2024-01-05 17:48] <Yakov> well, it was just gnome-terminal I called with desktop file
[2024-01-05 17:50] <leftyfb> Yakov: reboot, don't touch any custom apps. Does the stock gnome-terminal open and cloe on it's own using the built-in desktop file without problems?
[2024-01-05 17:50] <leftyfb> close*
[2024-01-05 17:50] <Yakov> yes
[2024-01-05 17:51] <leftyfb> Yakov: then the problem is with your app
[2024-01-05 17:51] <leftyfb> I recommend /join #c++ for help with tracking down the issue with it
[2024-01-05 17:52] <Yakov> the thing is I did not called my cpp app in this boot, I'm just trying to find syntax
[2024-01-05 17:53] <leftyfb> syntax for what?
[2024-01-05 17:55] <Yakov> I've opened 4 terminals, I need to kill last 3 and keep first one
[2024-01-05 17:55] <Yakov> https://justpaste.it/9wikd
[2024-01-05 17:55] <Yakov> pgrep -P 5379 | xargs kill -9 removes tree of processes, but terminals themselves are still open
[2024-01-05 17:56] <leftyfb> keep track of the PID's of the terminals you open and loop through that dict to kill the last 3
[2024-01-05 17:56] <leftyfb> again, this is a #c++ issue, not ubuntu
[2024-01-05 17:56] <Yakov> wait, I did not open my c++ app yet, its just stock gnome-terminal
[2024-01-05 17:57] <leftyfb> then why are you trying to kill terminals using CLI? Just close the windows
[2024-01-05 17:57] <leftyfb> with your mouse
[2024-01-05 17:57] <leftyfb> or type "exit" in each terminal
[2024-01-05 17:57] <Yakov> I need to kill 20 terminals, and keep two
[2024-01-05 17:58] <leftyfb> ok, drop the 2 you want to keep over to a corner of your desktop and close the rest
[2024-01-05 17:58] <leftyfb> why do you have 20 gnome-terminal windows open if you only want 2?
[2024-01-05 18:00] <Yakov> I debug some shit :)
[2024-01-05 18:13] <dgutov> Okay, I just had a crash again, with only two stock extensions (Ubuntu Dock and AppIndicators and another -- css-only -- extension called "Light Theme"):
[2024-01-05 18:13] <dgutov> Jan 05 20:03:35 potemkin kernel: Code: 14 0f 1f 44 00 00 49 83 ed 08 4c 39 6c 24 10 0f 84 ee 02 00 00 48 8b 83 28 01 00 00 4c 89 e6 4a 8b 2c 28 48 8b 45 00 48 8b 00 <48> 8b 38 e8 bc>

[2024-01-05 18:13] <dgutov> This one again wasn't captured by apport
[2024-01-05 18:13] <leftyfb> damn, for Yakov: for PID in $(ps -ef |grep $(ps -ef |awk '/[g]nome-terminal/ {print $2}') |awk '/bash/ {print $2}'|head -n-3); do sudo kill -9 $PID ;done
[2024-01-05 18:13] <leftyfb> but they left
[2024-01-05 18:14] <leftyfb> dgutov: did you reboot after removing the extensions?
[2024-01-05 18:14] <leftyfb> dgutov: also, "Light Theme" is not a stock extension. Remove it
[2024-01-05 18:16] <dgutov> Yep. Although what I did was disable+reboot. Is that enough?
[2024-01-05 18:16] <dgutov> Okay, I'll disable "light theme" as well
[2024-01-05 18:17] <leftyfb> I would remove them entirely
[2024-01-05 18:17] <leftyfb> you're trying to get back to as stock as you can get
[2024-01-05 18:17] <leftyfb> eliminate anything non-default
[2024-01-05 18:21] <dgutov> Okay, removed and rebooted
[2024-01-05 18:36] <yes-ubuntu> hello... is it possible to upgrade from 22.10 straight to 23.10 ?
[2024-01-05 18:37] <lotuspsychje> yes-ubuntu: 22.10 is end of life by now
[2024-01-05 18:38] <yes-ubuntu> lotuspsychje: okay... my question still stands :)
[2024-01-05 18:38] <leftyfb> yes-ubuntu: possible, yes. Likely to result in a stable system, no
[2024-01-05 18:39] <yes-ubuntu> leftyfb: thank you. how can I invoke the upgrade procedure? :D
[2024-01-05 18:39] <leftyfb> yes-ubuntu: non-LTS releases are only supported for 9 months
[2024-01-05 18:39] <lotuspsychje> yes-ubuntu: i would not reccomend upgrading from eol versions, the longer you wait, the more security issues coul arise
[2024-01-05 18:39] <leftyfb> yes-ubuntu: I might also point out, it's not supported and not recommended
[2024-01-05 18:41] <yes-ubuntu> I can't really understand that... ok, it is how it is. However, if it was possible to upgrade from 22.10 to 23.04 and then to 23.10, why isn't it possible to do the upgrade now?
[2024-01-05 18:42] <lotuspsychje> yes-ubuntu: leftyfb said its possible, we just dont reccomend it
[2024-01-05 18:42] <leftyfb> yes-ubuntu: I would highly recommend just installing ubuntu 22.04 from scratch. Stick with LTS's unless you are going to be upgrading every 9 months
[2024-01-05 18:42] <leftyfb> yes-ubuntu: or spend the time to upgrade manually through each version leading up to 23.10
[2024-01-05 18:43] <yes-ubuntu> so, is it possible to revert from 22.10 to 22.04 and then upgrade to 23.10 ?
[2024-01-05 18:43] <leftyfb> no
[2024-01-05 18:43] <lotuspsychje> yes-ubuntu: and if you choose the non-lts road, please upgrade to the next release 'before' your current release is end of life
[2024-01-05 18:43] <leftyfb> also, upgrading from 22.04 directly to 23.10 is also not officially supported
[2024-01-05 19:09] <bernd> hallo
[2024-01-05 19:31] <bernd> hello
[2024-01-05 19:32] <onkel> moinsen
[2024-01-05 19:32] <leftyfb> onkel: hello. What can we help you with?
[2024-01-05 20:13] <akram> h
[2024-01-05 20:15] <akram> can we use android in lubanto
[2024-01-05 20:16] <tomreyn> akram: you can connect your computer running lubuntu to another runnnig android. and you can use virtualization or containment to run variants of android on (under) lubuntu.
[2024-01-05 20:19] <NikNikovsky> does anyone know a way to get my wallpaper into Ubuntu?
[2024-01-05 20:22] <tomreyn> NikNikovsky: you mean for everyone, or just for you?
[2024-01-05 20:23] <NikNikovsky> for everyone to see
[2024-01-05 20:25] <tomreyn> you could try to have it added to an existing package, by requesting addition to where the package source is hosted. or by talking to the package maintainer. or you could write and publish a blog post to explain how others can manually add it to their ubuntu installation.
[2024-01-05 20:26] <NikNikovsky> i want to add it for EVERYONE to see, something like some people in the community did
[2024-01-05 20:27] <yes-ubuntu> okay! I have installed 23.10 and I have edited /etg/default/grub with nano and before restarting the system, I would need to execute sudo update-grub, however, I get this error: "/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of `/cow'." anyone could point me in the right direction? (I am still in the try ubuntu session, after having
[2024-01-05 20:27] <yes-ubuntu> installed the OS to the disk)
[2024-01-05 20:27] <tomreyn> NikNikovsky: there is usually a wallpaper competition for ubuntu, but there you'd neeed to comply with existing style guides, probably not what you're looking for. https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-23-10-wallpaper-competition/37235
[2024-01-05 20:30] <tomreyn> yes-ubuntu: you need to boot into the installed system first of all
[2024-01-05 20:30] <tomreyn> there's another approach, but it's more complicated
[2024-01-05 20:30] <yes-ubuntu> tomreyn: I thought so :)
[2024-01-05 20:40] <peacefulman> for 22.04, anyone get auto screen resizing with virtualbox working? I installed the virtualbox guest modules, but it seems I have to manually set the resolution
[2024-01-05 20:54] <yes-ubuntu> Hey! I have just installed Ubuntu 23.10 from a USB drive by selecting the Legacy USB at the one time bios boot menu. The screen was very pixel like (one pixel was huge on the screen)... nevertheless, the install went on (with nice graphics and good resolution) and after it finished, I removed the USB and restarted the system... and the same low
[2024-01-05 20:54] <yes-ubuntu> resolution black and white text display appeared, saying, there is no boot drive found? I can't seem to be able to select the internal SSD not even from the one time bios boot menu?
[2024-01-05 21:58] <mcc> Hello. I would like to upgrade the firmware on my laptop. There are several weird issues I am encountering.
[2024-01-05 21:59] <mcc> One, the first time I tried to do it after getting a notification I had a firmware update available, I got an error indicating Ubuntu had apparmor rules preventing me from upgrading the firmware. That sounds smart, but is there not some way to escalate privs? https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/111/654/885/772/750/809/original/575d5ca6ca41f168.jpg
[2024-01-05 22:01] <mcc> Two, when I went to try and test this again today, it says "Current version 0.1.30, Latest version 0.1.31" but hwen I click "Update to latest" it asks if I want to update Embedded Controller to "0.1.30". Why? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OjPlnR2M/Screenshot%20from%202024-01-05%2016-57-39.png
[2024-01-05 22:02] <mcc> Three, when I attempted to run the firmware updater tool in sudo, it just failed with a baffling error message. What does any of this mean? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ImkF1AiX/image.png
[2024-01-05 22:02] <tomreyn> about "one": did you receive another message stating what you said a message stated, or just the message which you posted a screenshot of (i don't think *this* message says what you said your message said).
[2024-01-05 22:03] <mcc> This is on Ubuntu 23.10
[2024-01-05 22:04] <mcc> tomreyn: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. I just got this big error box and then a second error box telling me not to reboot the computer while the firmware is updating. My comment about apparmor was a paraphrase. What I mean is it did not install and the error popup mentioned apparmor.
[2024-01-05 22:04] <tomreyn> about "two": if you clicked on "update to latest", this looks like a bug in the firmware updater snap to me.
[2024-01-05 22:04] <mcc> OK. Do you expect it is only a GUI error or might telling it to update do the wrong thing? Should I file this?
[2024-01-05 22:05] <mcc> (Incidentally, it also seems like a bug to me that after failing to update firmware and showing a error box saying it had failed to update firmware, it afterward showed the second "do not reboot while we install" box, apparently contradicting both the first error box and what the app was doing at that moment.)
[2024-01-05 22:05] <tomreyn> about "three": you should never run GUI applications as root
[2024-01-05 22:06] <tomreyn> (there are some applications parts of which will need to gain elevated permissions, but that's a different thing, and they will take care of it by themselves)
[2024-01-05 22:06] <mcc> Okay. Well, at the moment it appears the firmware updater snap is not correctly obtaining its elevated permissions
[2024-01-05 22:08] <causative> wtf the gnome rdp server doesn't work if the gui is on the lock screen????
[2024-01-05 22:10] <tomreyn> regarding your response "OK. Do you expect it is only a GUI error or might telling it to update do the wrong thing? Should I file this?" - i assume this is in response to my response to topic "A"? I fos: I'm not ebtirely sure what the effect of the error message presented is. what the message states is, i think, that apparmor rules prevented the firmware-updater application from getting a list of certain dbus properties from the running gnome
[2024-01-05 22:10] <tomreyn> session.
[2024-01-05 22:11] <causative> paternalistic pseudo-security crap
[2024-01-05 22:11] <tomreyn> causative: you are welcome to have opinions, but this is a support place. do you have a support question?
[2024-01-05 22:12] <causative> I want to remote desktop into my desktop, from my phone, wherever I am. This was working before. How do I get it working again.
[2024-01-05 22:12] <causative> or vnc into my desktop, whichever.
[2024-01-05 22:13] <leftyfb> causative: sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
[2024-01-05 22:13] <tomreyn> mcc: regarding your remark in parenthesis, i would also agree that this seems like a bug, too.
[2024-01-05 22:13] <leftyfb> causative: this will allow you to login remotely via RDP if it's on the lock screen, but not if you haven't logged in locally yet
[2024-01-05 22:15] <mcc> tomreyn: Sorry, I was unclear. I guess I have three questions: (1) How should I proceed (as I want to upgrade my firmware but I do not currently appear to be able to)? (2) Do the oddities in topic A or B seem to imply bugs which should be filed? (3) In (b), when it asks if I want to update the embedded controller to 0.1.30, do you think it *means* 0.1.31 (eg: should I expect Update to update to 0.1.31, despite the message)?
[2024-01-05 22:15] <tomreyn> mcc: regarding your remark "at the moment it appears the firmware updater snap is not correctly obtaining its elevated permissions", I think that elevated permissions and apparmor are not the same thing. i assume the firmware updater was able to gain elevated permissions, but some of what it tried to do seems to have been prevented by apparmor.
[2024-01-05 22:15] <mcc> ok, perhaps so
[2024-01-05 22:16] <tomreyn> mcc: on your next reboot you will see whether or not the firmware updater succeeded in staging a firmware update, in case this is yet unclear.
[2024-01-05 22:16] <mcc> tomreyn: i am going to try to file some of these items if I can reproduce them after an apt upgrade. do you think it would be more helpful to file one bug per oddity (0.1.30/0.1.31 confusion, apparmor/dbus error, spurious second dialog after the apparmor/dbus error) or one superbug?
[2024-01-05 22:16] <mcc> tomreyn: re "on your next reboot..." Oh. That makes sense.
[2024-01-05 22:17] <tomreyn> unless it actually stated that preparing firmware update failed, it may well have succeeded despite of the (misleading, and not helpful) apparmore related error message.
[2024-01-05 22:18] <mcc> i will try a reboot, then.
[2024-01-05 22:18] <tomreyn> mcc: always file separate bugs, only after checking which of those already have been filed
[2024-01-05 22:18] <causative> thanks leftyfb
[2024-01-05 22:19] <tomreyn> leftyfb: installing the gnome shell extension manager will allow connecting via RDP to a screen locked gnome shell session?
[2024-01-05 22:19] <tomreyn> if so, could you explain why? i'm just trying to lean, didn't know this.
[2024-01-05 22:20] <tomreyn> *leaRn
[2024-01-05 22:20] <leftyfb> sorry, missed a step
[2024-01-05 22:20] <leftyfb> after you you need to install the allow-locked-remote-desktop extension
[2024-01-05 22:20] <leftyfb> https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4338/allow-locked-remote-desktop/
[2024-01-05 22:20] <JanC> that makes more sense  :)
[2024-01-05 22:20] <leftyfb> yeah, sorry
[2024-01-05 22:21] <tomreyn> causative: ^ i think this goes to you
[2024-01-05 22:21] <leftyfb> googling for people and ansibling at the same time :)
[2024-01-05 22:21] <causative> yeah I already got it, thanks
[2024-01-05 22:22] <tomreyn> leftyfb: ah, glad we could clarify this one. :)
[2024-01-05 22:22] <mcc> What is the package for the software updater? (this is about something separate from the firmware updater issue). I tried to search on the bug reporter and got "sorry, something went wrong with your search" https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/4gCYsFKH/image.png
[2024-01-05 22:22] <causative> if my left shift, but not my right shift, is failing to work because of some software reason, is there anything I can do to fix it short of logging out?
[2024-01-05 22:22] <causative> anything I can restart that would help?
[2024-01-05 22:24] <tomreyn> you could try restarting your gnome-shell session on Xorg (won't work on wayland), by pressing alt-f2, typing "r" and pressing enter.
[2024-01-05 22:24] <leftyfb> causative: I don't think so
[2024-01-05 22:24] <tomreyn> replacing, not restarting, sorry
[2024-01-05 22:24] <leftyfb> tomreyn: yeah, they were asking about this yesterday. It's not possible on wayland
[2024-01-05 22:25] <tomreyn> There's always the chance that causative is running Xorg, I guess, unless you already clarified this yesterday, too.
[2024-01-05 22:26] <tomreyn> mcc: it'S the ubuntu-software snap, i think
[2024-01-05 22:26] <mcc> thakns
[2024-01-05 22:27] <tomreyn> hmm apparently this is wrong, at least therE's no such snap listed on snapcraft.
[2024-01-05 22:27] <tomreyn> .io
[2024-01-05 22:28] <mcc> It doesn't matter because I pressed the return key inside the component button and it posted my issue (to the SQLite3 component) :(
[2024-01-05 22:29] <tomreyn> i think it's https://snapcraft.io/snap-store
[2024-01-05 22:30] <mcc> So it's too late now, unless I can reassign the bug component myself, or you can do it https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sqlite3/+bug/2048405
[2024-01-05 22:30] <mcc> I have just rebooted. As you predicted, the firmware DID update during the reboot. So that's great.
[2024-01-05 22:31] <tomreyn> did it upgrade to the same version you already had, though, or to the newer version?
[2024-01-05 22:31] <tomreyn> journalctl -b | grep DMI:
[2024-01-05 22:31] <mcc> It upgraded to the newer version. 0.1.31.
[2024-01-05 22:32] <mcc> It is possible(?) that the weird "upgrade to 0.1.30"? was caused by the fact the update had already run and was pending install.
[2024-01-05 22:32] <tomreyn> good, so i guess you just have a misleading error message and a misbehaving firmware update (trying some restricted action which it probably should not be trying) and an incorrectly reported target version.
[2024-01-05 22:32] <mcc> Yes. The "do not interrupt me while I'm installing this!" message was the correct one, not the error message.
[2024-01-05 22:33] <tomreyn> mcc: which package should 2048405 be reassigned to?
[2024-01-05 22:34] <tomreyn> (it does look quite sqlite related)
[2024-01-05 22:34] <mcc> tomreyn: really? if you think it's sqlite related it can stay. as noted tho it happened with 3 different packages.
[2024-01-05 22:35] <mcc> tomreyn: it should be assigned to whichever package owns the program that runs when I search in the "show apps" menu for "software updater" and click "software updater". above, you speculated it was snapcraft.io/snap-store.
[2024-01-05 22:35] <tomreyn> mcc: i guess the real question is why you have a read-onl file system at /usr
[2024-01-05 22:35] <mcc> tomreyn: yes, that's an interesting question. actually, it is persisting after a reboot
[2024-01-05 22:36] <mcc> Or rather, after a reboot, attempts to run software updater results in this: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mgIUbY13/image.png
[2024-01-05 22:38] <tomreyn> hmm your dmesg (posted on this bug report) is full of suspends + resumes
[2024-01-05 22:38] <mcc> over what time period?
[2024-01-05 22:39] <mcc> I would expect several suspend+resume cycles a day because this is a laptop which spends most of its time closed and stowed under a desk.
[2024-01-05 22:40] <mcc> Do you know what the component is for `/snap/bin/firmware-updater`, or how I would find out? the launchpad "select a package" search is not very helpfulâ¦ :(
[2024-01-05 22:40] <tomreyn> ~300k seconds
[2024-01-05 22:41] <mcc> That's 83 hours. I have definitely suspend/resumed many times over the last 83 hours.
[2024-01-05 22:42] <mcc> I attempted a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade and got the same read-only file ystem error.
[2024-01-05 22:42] <tomreyn> actually 451545 s
[2024-01-05 22:42] <tomreyn> 125h
[2024-01-05 22:42] <mcc> well, same expectations.
[2024-01-05 22:43] <tomreyn> well, try to find out why your file system is read-only
[2024-01-05 22:43] <tomreyn> use journalctl
[2024-01-05 22:43] <tomreyn> use mount
[2024-01-05 22:43] <tomreyn> or   cat /proc/mounts
[2024-01-05 22:43] <tomreyn> verify /etc/fstab
[2024-01-05 22:43] <tomreyn> use lsblk and / or blkid
[2024-01-05 22:44] <tomreyn> there are no bugs with those packages, your file system is not mounted, which is not related to these packages
[2024-01-05 22:45] <mcc> I agree, which is why I wanted to file against software updater :( however from what you say maybe it is not the software updater either.
[2024-01-05 22:45] <tomreyn> the software updater should not be causing your /usr file system to be mounted ro
[2024-01-05 22:46] <tomreyn> and so far we have no indication that it did
[2024-01-05 22:46] <mcc> might the firmware updater have done this?
[2024-01-05 22:46] <tomreyn> we could speculate on random packages having caused it, or you could check your logs on what happened
[2024-01-05 22:46] <mcc> like, locked the filesystem in anticipation of a reboot, then failed to set things right after the reboot. seems a little unlikely maybe...
[2024-01-05 22:47] <tomreyn> no, this doesn't make any sense
[2024-01-05 22:47] <mcc> ok.
[2024-01-05 22:47] <tomreyn> it would prevent a clean shutdown
[2024-01-05 22:48] <tomreyn> the firmware updater application just puts the firmware update in place where the firmware can then find it and update itself on reboot.
[2024-01-05 22:48] <mcc> i have gathered all those things you asked for above, except for journalctl, which without further refinement goes back to oct 17.
[2024-01-05 22:48] <mcc> I can post a zip hereâ there is no security/privacy concern with posting them in the irc channel is there?
[2024-01-05 22:48] <mcc> /etc/fstab looks normal as anything to me , by which I mean I don't see any weird options.
[2024-01-05 22:48] <bprompt> mcc:  there are places you can post a zip file for hosting btw
[2024-01-05 22:49] <tomreyn> journalctl -b    get you the log of the active session,  -b -1   gets the one from before last reboot
[2024-01-05 22:49] <tomreyn> ...and so on
[2024-01-05 22:49] <mcc> bprompt: i believe irccloud does this for me, i just want to get a confirmation these drive GUIDs aren't sensitive information somehow
[2024-01-05 22:49] <tomreyn> you can filter logs messages to only see warnings (-p4) or just errors (-p3)
[2024-01-05 22:50] <tomreyn> --list-boots shows which session matches which time period
[2024-01-05 22:51] <bprompt> mcc:  in essence, you can /dcc send NICK to anyone, doable with an irc client menu too, however the NICK must consent to receive it, and you'd want to first ask for allowing it, many may say no
[2024-01-05 22:51] <tomreyn> there can be unique hardware IDs on the journalctl output (just liek on dmesg)
[2024-01-05 22:52] <mcc> This is from current session journalctl, today: Jan 05 17:29:12 Anthy kernel: EXT4-fs (nvme0n1p3): mounted filesystem ecb1730b-cbe1-457c-a4f8-23e2eaf89020 ro with ordered data mode. Quota mode: none.
[2024-01-05 22:52] <mcc> It doesn't say why it did that.
[2024-01-05 22:52] <tomreyn> there could also be information you have entered / assigned, such as wlan access point names or your user accounts full name.
[2024-01-05 22:53] <mcc> ok well hopefully that ecb thing i just posted isn't sensitive :P
[2024-01-05 22:53] <tomreyn> where did it mount this one to, though / where does it usually get mounted to? it's not necessarily wrong to have ro mounts
[2024-01-05 22:54] <tomreyn> filesystem and partition UUIDs are automatically generated, there is not much sensitive info in there, other than when they were generated.
[2024-01-05 22:56] <mcc> https://data.runhello.com/j/ubuntu/readonly/readonly-fs-mystery.zip
[2024-01-05 22:57] <mcc> those are the mountpoints and such
[2024-01-05 23:00] <tomreyn> can you show the output of:  findmnt --target /usr
[2024-01-05 23:00] <alcosta> Hi everybody! Is here leftyfb!
[2024-01-05 23:01] <tomreyn> mcc: i'm guessing nvme0n1p3 is your /
[2024-01-05 23:01] <mcc> I'd expect so
[2024-01-05 23:01] <mcc> /usr sysext overla ro,relatime,lowerdir=/run/systemd/sysext/meta/usr:/run/systemd/sysext/extensions/cosmic-sysext/
[2024-01-05 23:01] <tomreyn> though the lsblk output is weird
[2024-01-05 23:01] <mcc> Hmm so this is interesting
[2024-01-05 23:01] <mcc> I did install a systemd sysext
[2024-01-05 23:01] <mcc> I forgot this until now because I thought it was insignificant
[2024-01-05 23:02] <mcc> (sorry)
[2024-01-05 23:02] <mcc> My expectation from the directions I followed was that this would result in an overlay of additional files visible in the /usr directory , not that it would supplant the /usr mountpoint entire with a readonly one
[2024-01-05 23:03] <tomreyn> i'm not really familiar with systemd sysext, but a quick glance on the man page seems to suggest it does change things quite a bit. i suggest you undo it, if that's possible, or reinstall
[2024-01-05 23:04] <mcc> yes, from the manpage "System extension images are strictly read-only, and the host /usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies become read-only too while they are activated." :(
[2024-01-05 23:04] <mcc> well, that's easy to fix then.
[2024-01-05 23:05] <tomreyn> possibly, but undoing the harm that the fact that /usr has been unwritable for a while may not be as easy to fix
[2024-01-05 23:05] <tomreyn> you will see
[2024-01-05 23:05] <tomreyn> maybe someone else here is more familiar with what you did.
[2024-01-05 23:05] <alcosta> Eventually I solved the problem I discussed with leftyfb! Thanks to his suggestions!
[2024-01-05 23:06] <Cahata> hello
[2024-01-05 23:06] <alcosta> Now I have another problem, in some way similar to the previous one, but different!
[2024-01-05 23:06] <Cahata> is ubuntu on rpi 5 usable as home pc ?
[2024-01-05 23:06] <tomreyn> alcosta: thanks for reporting back (i don't know what  it was about). if you think it is useful knowledge, you could share how you solved it.
[2024-01-05 23:07] <alcosta> Hi tomreyn! In the exact way leftyfb suggested me to work with it!
[2024-01-05 23:07] <tomreyn> alcosta: nice. :)
[2024-01-05 23:08] <tomreyn> Cahata: possibly, with limitations.
[2024-01-05 23:09] <bprompt> Cahata:  last I bother checking, is just a headless version, streamlined, but is just headless, is all
[2024-01-05 23:10] <alcosta> Hi have two desktop PC, PC A and PC B, running ubutnu 20.04. On PC A I have a Virtual Machine VMA, on PC B I have a Virtual Machine VMB. I wanted that all the machines can communicate therebeteen. All the Machines are running ubuntu 20.04.
[2024-01-05 23:10] <tomreyn> Cahata: a SoC is not really comparable to a 'proper' desktop or laptop computer. but you should be able to run ubuntu on it in a usable way.
[2024-01-05 23:10] <tomreyn> Cahata: i do assume that you can run a graphical desktop on it.
[2024-01-05 23:10] <mcc> After removing the extension and rebooting I can now run software updater correctly. Tomreyn thanks for the help
[2024-01-05 23:11] <tomreyn> mcc: you're welcome. i suggest closing you bug report(s) then, at least those you cannot reproduce now.
[2024-01-05 23:12] <alcosta> Eventually, with the suggestions of leftyfb about the definition of a bridge network, I was able to connect all the machines! :)
[2024-01-05 23:13] <mcc> I added a note to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sqlite3/+bug/2048405 requesting it to be closed, but if there is a button to close it myself I do not see it. Will changing status to "Invalid" do it?
[2024-01-05 23:13] <Cahata> tomreyn that for sure... just intrested in small pc as a sandbox for torrents ...
[2024-01-05 23:13] <Cahata> thanks for answers :)
[2024-01-05 23:14] <tomreyn> mcc: yes, that's the only option there is
[2024-01-05 23:15] <tomreyn> Cahata: it should work for a small torrent seed node as long as you don't expect to use too much bandwidth.
[2024-01-05 23:15] <alcosta> Now, I would like to solve a similar problem, but a litle different: I have a PC A with a VMA, both running ubuntu 20.04 and a PC B, running windows 10, with a VMB running ubuntu 20.04. How can I enable the four machines to communicate therebetween?
[2024-01-05 23:16] <tomreyn> whats a VMA and a VMB?
[2024-01-05 23:17] <mcc> One more question. Is there a convenient way to get a window back into usable range when the title bar moves above the top of the screen? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/1BkSsNtf/image.png
[2024-01-05 23:18] <tomreyn> ah i guess you mean "VM A" (as in "virtual machine one") and "VM B" (as in "virtual machine two")
[2024-01-05 23:18] <bprompt> tomreyn: in essence he said, VM running on PC "A" and VM running on PC "B"
[2024-01-05 23:18] <mcc> Ubuntu is constantly popping up this on-screen keyboard (I do not want this, ever, but I looked into it and there appears to be no way to disable it), when it pops up all the windows move upward to make room for it, and sometimes they don't move back down afterward
[2024-01-05 23:18] <bprompt> alcosta: pardon my meddling, let's nevermind VM for a second, what are you trying to achieve at all?
[2024-01-05 23:18] <tomreyn> mcc: hold down meta and move the window around anywhere on the window
[2024-01-05 23:18] <leftyfb> alcosta: I would recommend you join #kvm to learn how to configure your VM's to utilize the bridges you created. Once you do that, they should all be on the same network as the hosts
[2024-01-05 23:19] <alcosta> VMA is a Virtual Machine running ubuntu 20.04 on the PC A, whereas VMB is a Virtual Machine running ubutnu 20.04 on the PC B. In this case, PC B is running under Windows 10. Have I to define a similar bridge network under Windows 10? How have I to do that?
[2024-01-05 23:19] <tomreyn> mcc: that's drag + drop with your mouse
[2024-01-05 23:19] <mcc> tomreyn: sorry, i don't think I know what meta is. alt, ctrl, and compose did not do anything.
[2024-01-05 23:19] <leftyfb> bprompt: 4 machines on the same network. 2 are hosts, 2 are VM's. We already created bridge interfaces on the hosts. Now the VM's need to be configured to use the bridge interfaces
[2024-01-05 23:19] <tomreyn> mcc: "windows key"
[2024-01-05 23:20] <mcc> Oh. I reassigned that to compose. Um. Hm.
[2024-01-05 23:20] <bprompt> hmm ok
[2024-01-05 23:21] <dgutov> mcc: There's this: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3222/block-caribou-36/
[2024-01-05 23:21] <mcc> dgutov: oh, that is great. thank you so much.
[2024-01-05 23:21] <mcc> i have a laptop with a touchscreen so i literally never want or need the onscreen keyboard.
[2024-01-05 23:21] <dgutov> np! same here
[2024-01-05 23:22] <alcosta> Hi leftyfb, thank for your suggestions on bridge network. Eventually, it worked! All the machines can communicate therebetween! Now, a bit different situation: what if when PC B is running Windows 10 and the other three Machines are running ubuntu 20.04?
[2024-01-05 23:22] <leftyfb> alcosta: ok?
[2024-01-05 23:23] <leftyfb> alcosta: if all machines are on the same network (check the ip addresses, they should all be the same except for the last octet) then they are all "connected".
[2024-01-05 23:23] <alcosta> Under ubuntu 20.04 the four Machines are correctly working! They communicate all together!
[2024-01-05 23:24] <mcc> I think I am not going to file my issues with firmware-updater because the chances they are due to the readonly filesystem issue are so high.
[2024-01-05 23:25] <tomreyn> mcc: i'd make the same choice, and keep an eye on whether they re-occur next time a firmware upgrade is available
[2024-01-05 23:25] <mcc> makes sense. thanks
[2024-01-05 23:26] <alcosta> Now I'm trying to work with another condition, you can also consider a new PC C, running Windows 10, with a Virtual Machine running ubuntu 20.04.
[2024-01-05 23:26] <leftyfb> alcosta: you need to /join #windows for that
[2024-01-05 23:26] <alcosta> In the real case, PC C is the same computer B in condition of dual booting with Windows 10.
[2024-01-05 23:27] <alcosta> Ah, there is a channel windows too! Good to know!
[2024-01-05 23:27] <leftyfb> alcosta: if Windows is the host, then you need to go to #windows for support with creating a bridge interface for that host
[2024-01-05 23:29] <alcosta> Ah, OK! Thank you leftyfb! I will do this way! I will ask in windows channel! Thank you again for the suggestions about bridge network! This was a good week for me! Great job well done! :)
[2024-01-05 23:35] <alcosta> And a last (maybe but.. maybe not last too!) question: I developed a new App that partially is coded in nodejs and partially in python (among some other things). The way I used for communicating data between nodejs and python is through pipe files available under ubuntu 20.04 (and linux in general). I want the same App can work under windows 10 (or 11, is good too).
[2024-01-05 23:36] <leftyfb> alcosta: that's beyond the scope of this channel. Try #python or #nodejs
[2024-01-05 23:36] <leftyfb> !alis | alcosta
[2024-01-05 23:36] <ubottu> alcosta: Alis is an IRC service to help you find channels. For help on using it, see Â«/msg Alis help listÂ» or ask in #libera - Example usage: Â«/msg Alis list httpÂ»
[2024-01-05 23:38] <alcosta> AH, ok! Thank you leftyfb and ubottu! I'm new in this chat, I'm using it from less than two weeks! Thank you again in any way! :)
[2024-01-05 23:40] <bprompt> alcosta: https://netsplit.de/channels/?net=freenode   <---- you can do a quick channels search there as well
[2024-01-05 23:41] <bprompt> alcosta: some of the guys at #javascript also do nodejs btw, since it's really just js for the server
[2024-01-05 23:45] <alcosta> ubottu - I write as you said: Â«/msg Alis help listÂ» but... nothing happens!
[2024-01-05 23:46] <alcosta> here as in #libera!
[2024-01-05 23:47] <alcosta> Any way, I will ask in #windows - #python and #nodejs! Thanks again!
[2024-01-05 23:50] <Bashing-om> alcosta: Alis' output will show in a new window.
[2024-01-05 23:52] <bprompt> alcosta: https://netsplit.de/channels/?net=Libera.Chat    <---- updated  link, to search channels
[2024-01-05 23:52] <bprompt> gave you an old one before
[2024-01-05 23:52] <alcosta> Bashing-om, I don't see any new window!
[2024-01-05 23:54] <Bashing-om> alcosta: running the command like:  /msg Alis help list ?
[2024-01-05 23:55] <Kangarooo> For triaging bug report. To check a bug, i would like to know is this good strategy- to find all files containing shortcut meta, so i can find shortcuts configuration files is it good to search all files? what search would be best?
[2024-01-05 23:56] <alcosta> Bashing-om - I cut and paste /msg Alis help list and nothing happens!
[2024-01-06 00:01] <Bashing-om> alcosta: What IRC client are you using ? My irssi client puts the output in a new window that the server creates.
[2024-01-06 00:37] <alcosta> Sorry, Bashing-om, I was discussing on #python and I din't see your replay! I'm using gamja (https://web.libera.chat/gamja/).
[2024-01-06 00:40] <Bashing-om> alcosta: I have no experience with gamja // maybe look in the status window (1) for the output ?
[2024-01-06 00:41] <bprompt> alcosta: no option to use a native irc client?
[2024-01-06 00:42] <alcosta> Sorry, bpromt! What do you mean with "no option to use a native irc client?" I don't understand!
[2024-01-06 00:44] <alcosta> Sorry, Bashing-om, I'm writing on a page of google chrome! I don't see any status window (1)!
[2024-01-06 00:45] <Bashing-om> alcosta: Well, I am out of ideas :(
[2024-01-06 00:46] <bprompt> alcosta:  there are many native irc clients, which is what Bashing-om is referring to with saying irssi,  hmmm
[2024-01-06 00:47] <bprompt> alcosta:  for example, I use hexchat -> https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b2/0b/00/b20b000f45b9c223ab1400c92c00c44e.png
[2024-01-06 00:53] <alcosta> Thank you, bprompt! I will look for a native irc client and see what is the best for me (maybe the first one I'll find!). Thank you! :)
[2024-01-06 00:55] <alcosta> Here in Italy is 01:53 AM. I don't know there, but here it's time to go to bed! Good night! :)
[2024-01-06 01:02] <xangua> Isn't hexchat gtk2?
[2024-01-06 01:06] <bprompt> xangua:   dunno, offhand I don't know any gtk2 apps these days, mind you that updating to gtk3 using CSS rules for many apps and distribution happened about 10 years or so ago
[2024-01-06 01:07] <bprompt> it may be gtk, but definitely not 2
[2024-01-06 01:07] <rbox> hexchat is most defintely gtk2
[2024-01-06 01:38] <tomreyn> https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/hexchat or "apt-cache depends hexchat | grep libgtk"
[2024-01-06 02:25] <guzzlefry> Hello, I just did a release upgrade from 20.04 to 22.04. For some reason the mount points for my external drives now have a 1 appended to the end of the UUIDs. Any way to fix?
[2024-01-06 02:26] <guzzlefry> For clarity, the old mount point was /media/guz/11466b05-9b41-48f5-b8cb-a3b3ca91a617. It's now /media/guz/11466b05-9b41-48f5-b8cb-a3b3ca91a6171 (note the additional 1 at the end)
[2024-01-06 02:27] <sarnold> wild
[2024-01-06 02:29] <guzzlefry> oh, it seems the old directory is now removed once the drive is unmounted. :P
[2024-01-06 03:41] <morgan-u2> can I check my internet connection, speed in terminal?

[2024-01-06 06:53] <Guest15> hi, I am trying to install ubuntu 24.04 LTS daily build (current) to my laptop. The live system works but the installer app shows a white blank window. Do anyone have a workaround to install it? thanks a lot.
[2024-01-06 06:54] <guiverc> Guest15, @ubuntu-next is where you can ask about unreleased products (this room is released only), and yes that's a known issue
[2024-01-06 06:54] <guiverc> (there are multiple ISOs using different installers too)
[2024-01-06 06:55] <Guest15> guiverc, thanks a lot for the tip. I will join @ubuntu-next then.
[2024-01-06 06:56] <guiverc> sorry I typed @ when I meant #... if using ubuntu-desktop-installer ISO your issue is likely https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-desktop-installer/+bug/2043915 Guest15
[2024-01-06 06:57] <guiverc> (for more, please ask in #ubuntu-next..)
[2024-01-06 07:50] <xxy> i open port with iptables in Ubuntu 20.04 , "sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT" ,then i check rule, it exist, lile this "ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:socks
[2024-01-06 07:50] <xxy> ", then i noticed that port can't open yet with "ss" command
[2024-01-06 07:51] <xxy> how to open a port with iptables
[2024-01-06 07:52] <CosmicDJ> xxy: why don't you just use ufw?
[2024-01-06 07:53] <CosmicDJ> xxy: sudo ufw allow port 8080
[2024-01-06 07:54] <ravage> xxy: if the port is not open in general your firewall is not the problem
[2024-01-06 07:56] <CosmicDJ> xxy: and what ravage said, any port you open in your firewall will not magically show up in ss unless you have some program running that listens on this port (you can use nc to test -> nc -l 8080)
[2024-01-06 07:58] <causative> xxy, show us sudo iptables -L -v, perhaps there is another rule blocking the port
[2024-01-06 08:00] <causative> and also you don't want to use iptables and ufw at the same time, maybe ufw is blocking the port when you allowed it in iptables
[2024-01-06 08:09] <xxy1> CosmicDJ:  if using ufw. it will let ssh broken
[2024-01-06 08:10] <xxy1> causative: it is only one rule "ACCEPT  tcp  --  anywhere  anywhere  tcp dpt:socks" in filter table
[2024-01-06 08:14] <causative> I'm not sure what port dpt:socks refers to, it might be 1030? anyway what does "sudo iptables-save" say
[2024-01-06 08:14] <causative> paste the output
[2024-01-06 08:14] <causative> to a pastebin
[2024-01-06 08:15] <causative> anyway if that's the only rule and the input default is ACCEPT then the rule is not doing anything
[2024-01-06 08:15] <causative> unless the input default is REJECT
[2024-01-06 08:16] <causative> or DROP
[2024-01-06 08:17] <xxy1> causative: https://paste.centos.org/view/23d41793
[2024-01-06 08:18] <causative> yeah, that's not doing anything, it accepts everything
[2024-01-06 08:18] <xxy1> causative: how to let it works?
[2024-01-06 08:19] <causative> iptables is not interfering with your port
[2024-01-06 08:19] <causative> if there is a problem connecting to your port, iptables is not to blame
[2024-01-06 08:19] <causative> iptables is also not providing any security but that's a different problem
[2024-01-06 08:34] <xxy> causative: if i enable UFW, then remote server can't be login
[2024-01-06 09:21] <tomreyn> causative: in "dpt:socks", "dpt" refers to "destination port", and "socks" refers to the output of   grep ^socks /etc/services

[2024-01-06 12:42] <MortifiedPenguin> Hello everybody, i am fairly new to IRC and i was wondering: how can i ensure that the messages i send in a channel are encrypted? I am using Mozilla Thunderbird as IRC client (which I already figured is maybe not the best option available) on Ubuntu 22.04 and while i explicitly see an "encryption" icon for one to one chats it seems not to be available in channels.
[2024-01-06 12:42] <MortifiedPenguin> If somebody got any useful info it would be appreciated
[2024-01-06 12:47] <vincejv> MortifiedPenguin if ur'e connecting thru SSL commonly port 6697, your messages are pretty much encrypted
[2024-01-06 12:49] <ravage> there is transport encryption. no end to end encryption
[2024-01-06 12:49] <ravage> people with access to the server can read all channel messages
[2024-01-06 12:50] <MortifiedPenguin> Thank you both for the help
[2024-01-06 12:50] <MortifiedPenguin> ravage: that makes sense, my bad
[2024-01-06 12:51] <ravage> you can look into Matrix if you want to get into E2E enctrypted rooms. Thunderbird supports that too. An alternative client would be https://element.io/
[2024-01-06 12:52] <ravage> you can find the Ubuntu Matrix Community at https://matrix.to/#/#community:ubuntu.com
[2024-01-06 12:54] <MortifiedPenguin> Actually i might look into that as I'm noticing now that I can't start encrypted one-to-one conversations (at least with the ChanServ and NickServ) but mostly I think i have to spend some time getting a better grasp of how IRC actually works
[2024-01-06 12:54] <MortifiedPenguin> Thanks again for the suggestion though

[2024-01-06 15:53] <Thermoriax> What's the accepted way to modify keymapping these days? Like if I wanted my capslock to be an escape key, or I have a key xubuntu doesn't seem to see? I've read xmodmap isn't the thing anymore (though I do appear to have it installed).
[2024-01-06 15:54] <lotuspsychje> Thermoriax: there's a hand app on the repos input-remapper you can try
[2024-01-06 16:02] <Thermoriax> The pile of issues on github doesn't inspire confidence. I'll keep looking. :)
[2024-01-06 16:08] <lotuspsychje> !info input-remapper | Thermoriax

[2024-01-06 16:08] <Thermoriax> ah, my bad. I thought you meant the one on github, which looks nice but very buggy. :)
[2024-01-06 16:11] <Thermoriax> Which is in fact that github package, just much older than latest.
[2024-01-06 16:12] <Thermoriax> Thanks for the suggestion though.
[2024-01-06 16:12] <cloudbender> linux is hard

[2024-01-06 16:13] <cloudbender> I used SystemV Unix years ago, but things have changed.
[2024-01-06 16:14] <cloudbender> I did manage to get a print queue built
[2024-01-06 16:14] <cloudbender> It's slowly coming back to me ...

[2024-01-06 16:48] <cloudbender> What is the 'Device URI' referenced in a print queue 'Settings' dialog ?
[2024-01-06 16:49] <rbox> what does it say?
[2024-01-06 16:49] <cloudbender> Is that a reference back to the queue ? Or a reference to the queues assigned printer ?
[2024-01-06 16:50] <cloudbender> ipp://zqueue1.local/ipp/print
[2024-01-06 16:50] <rbox> thats the device in cups
[2024-01-06 17:28] <cloudbender> So, the Device URI is how (other) hosts discover the printer and connect to it ?
[2024-01-06 17:28] <cloudbender> https://imagebin.ca/v/7nHLxIzHtOCo
[2024-01-06 17:29] <rbox> yes, thts how to connect to cups
[2024-01-06 17:30] <cloudbender> Sorry, I'm an expert at windoze printing, but cups is different.
[2024-01-06 17:31] <MrMobius> does Ubuntu let you log in over USB serial by default?
[2024-01-06 17:31] <cloudbender> I have legacy terminal apps which require legacy print semantics.Â  I'm hoping to get the print routes stablized before I choose a terminal emulator.
[2024-01-06 17:32] <rbox> MrMobius: no, you have to enable a getty for the port
[2024-01-06 19:41] <coderman1> i had a server just turn off in a data center, data center employees arent very helpful. what log can i look in to see why it turned off? syslog doesnt have much
[2024-01-06 19:42] <ravage> if the system is back online you can use journalctl
[2024-01-06 19:42] <ravage> journalctl --list-boots

[2024-01-06 19:54] <dell> Do you speak Hungarian?
[2024-01-06 21:51] <anotheryou> Hi, how to install ubuntu alongside win11 with bitlocker? Did: disable secure boot, shrunk win partition within windows. Observed: Ubuntu installer did not seem to see(?) the unallocated free space. Maybe I have to use a non default option in the installer?
[2024-01-06 21:51] <anotheryou> Or should I create a partition in win?
[2024-01-06 21:51] <anotheryou> (only to reformat it within the installer)
[2024-01-06 21:52] <rbox> are you sure theres free space?
[2024-01-06 21:52] <anotheryou> yes, 250gb or something
[2024-01-06 21:52] <anotheryou> I see it in the windows partition manager
[2024-01-06 21:53] <rbox> screenshot
[2024-01-06 21:53] <rbox> and what is the error in ubuntu
[2024-01-06 21:54] <anotheryou> will get you both, will take a while (installer loading from sloow usb :) )
[2024-01-06 21:57] <anotheryou> rbox: https://i.imgur.com/Ellsx2u.png windows partition manager

[2024-01-06 22:08] <anotheryou> rbox: ubuntu "error": https://i.imgur.com/D683814.png
[2024-01-06 22:09] <anotheryou> I can go to the partition manager and could create an Ext4 in the empty space there, but I'm not sure what I'm doing there :)
[2024-01-06 22:10] <anotheryou> partition manager ubuntu installer: https://i.imgur.com/p1wPspS.jpeg
[2024-01-06 22:11] <rbox> i mean, the link it provides expalisn it...
[2024-01-06 22:11] <jeremy31> Choose the free space use ext4 and mount point /
[2024-01-06 22:12] <jeremy31> install bootloader to nvme0n1
[2024-01-06 22:12] <anotheryou> jeremy31: and that would not corrupt my windows install?
[2024-01-06 22:13] <jeremy31> anotheryou: you already made Windows rescue disks and backup up the Windows install in case something does go wrong?
[2024-01-06 22:14] <anotheryou> jeremy31: no :). but the only thing valuable to me would be the windows license
[2024-01-06 22:14] <anotheryou> otherwise i fresh machine with nothing on it
[2024-01-06 22:14] <anotheryou> a
[2024-01-06 22:16] <anotheryou> well I guess disabeling bitlocker is easiest
[2024-01-06 22:16] <anotheryou> I can do that
[2024-01-06 22:16] <jeremy31> anotheryou: The license might be in UEFI but you would need install disk/USB with same Windows version
[2024-01-06 22:16] <anotheryou> jeremy31: makes sense to just disable it and try the ubuntu installer again?
[2024-01-06 22:17] <anotheryou> and big thanks to both of you for helping me :)
[2024-01-06 22:17] <jeremy31> anotheryou: Make Windows backups first.  Then do my suggestions for installing Ubuntu
[2024-01-06 22:18] <anotheryou> jeremy31: ok :) any recommendation for how to do the backup?
[2024-01-06 22:21] <anotheryou> I guess "create recovery drive" is exactly what I need..
[2024-01-06 22:30] <jeremy31> anotheryou: Look in Windows help files

[2024-01-06 23:02] <teddybearcell> Seems the FBI shut down most book / academic research papers channels on IRC. I suppose that makes sense ...
[2024-01-06 23:03] <anotheryou> since when is this channel so slow? used to be one of the busiest ones on freenode, no?
[2024-01-06 23:03] <anotheryou> did people move to matrix?
[2024-01-06 23:09] <Jibwood> A lot of people on discord tbh @anotheryou
[2024-01-06 23:19] <anotheryou> Jibwood: there is an official discord?
[2024-01-06 23:20] <Jibwood> @anotheryou: yes, Ubuntu Hideout
[2024-01-06 23:27] <bparker> lol discord
[2024-01-06 23:27] <bparker> never again (they won't even let me)
[2024-01-06 23:27] <bparker> as soon as I try to join I get instant phone-walled
[2024-01-06 23:27] <Jibwood> Yeah I'm not a fan
[2024-01-06 23:27] <Jibwood> Full of kids
[2024-01-06 23:27] <bparker> no matter what connection, browser or IP I try to use, always the same
[2024-01-06 23:27] <bparker> sometimes it happens later, sometimes it's immediate
[2024-01-06 23:40] <anotheryou> :( dualboot and encrypting the linux part is *also* difficult -_-... I thought I just disable bitlocker for win, but linux I'd like encrypted
[2024-01-06 23:41] <Jibwood> on the same HDD/SSD?
[2024-01-06 23:41] <anotheryou> yes
[2024-01-06 23:41] <bparker> works fine for me
[2024-01-06 23:42] <anotheryou> bparker: how?
[2024-01-06 23:52] <bparker> anotheryou: by just doing it? I don't understand the issue
[2024-01-06 23:53] <bparker> I've done dual-boot encryption with both zfs builtin encryption on the linux side as well as ecryptfs
[2024-01-06 23:55] <anotheryou> bparker: well at least the ubuntu installer does not offer it anymore
[2024-01-06 23:56] <anotheryou> I mean, does not for a partition
[2024-01-06 23:56] <bparker> mine was installed to a partition
[2024-01-06 23:56] <bparker> with the default 22.04 installer
[2024-01-06 23:56] <anotheryou> guess ecryptfs is the way to go
[2024-01-06 23:57] <anotheryou> which seems to need quite a few command line hoops to be jumped through
[2024-01-06 23:57] <anotheryou> if this is the way to do it still: https://jumpcloud.com/blog/how-to-encrypt-ubuntu-20-04-desktop-post-installation
[2024-01-06 23:58] <bparker> it's literally one command
[2024-01-06 23:58] <bparker> > $ sudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u winnie
[2024-01-06 23:58] <anotheryou> oh ok
[2024-01-06 23:59] <anotheryou> and from than on swap and home are encrypted on log-off and standby?
[2024-01-07 00:00] <anotheryou> and it doesn't need that second admin user?
[2024-01-07 00:02] <bparker> just login as root to do it
[2024-01-07 00:02] <bparker> it's just that you can't be logged in as the user you want to encrypt
[2024-01-07 00:03] <bparker> at least where you run the command at
[2024-01-07 00:05] <anotheryou> ah, I'll need another tutorial for that XD https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-login-root/
[2024-01-07 00:05] <anotheryou> I get that this is easy for you
[2024-01-07 00:05] <anotheryou> but that seems to be ~20 commands in total. it's not easy for me and I don't think it quite falls under "just one command" :)
[2024-01-07 00:06] <anotheryou> anyways, thanks for the help! I'll catch some sleep and think about whether to do this again tomorrow
[2024-01-07 00:58] <causative> well, RDP is extremely slow when scrolling.. dunno if ubuntu is to blame or my rdp android client
[2024-01-07 00:59] <causative> but anyway I'm back to VNC with Xorg, giving up on wayland
[2024-01-07 01:02] <causative> maybe the problem was the encryption slowing RDP down, but there were no options to remove it (I'm using an ssh tunnel with a firewall so rdp/vnc can only be accessed from localhost, and dont need another encryption layer)
[2024-01-07 01:14] <causative> and I guess when ubuntu drops support for xorg, I may need to drop ubuntu
[2024-01-07 01:28] <tomreyn> bparker / anotheryou: ecryptfs has security relevant shortcomings and isn't recommended anymore.
[2024-01-07 01:29] <tomreyn> use 'full disk' encryption via dm-crypt luks or a supported file system encryption.

[2024-01-07 06:32] <xxy> i hope to forward traffic from A VPS to B vps with iptables , and A VPS listen destination port "1080" , the PREROUTNG rule like "iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1080 -j DNAT --to-destination 60.234.77.235", then using "ufw allow 1080/tcp",check status is "1080/tcp allow anywhere", then i check from client "nc -vz 60.235.45.114 1080", connection is fail. i noticed all opened port have a application accordingly , if using iptables , how to let that port
[2024-01-07 06:32] <xxy> open?
[2024-01-07 06:46] <tomreyn> xxy: are you sure 60.234.77.235 is the right ip address? that's a mobile network operator from new zealand (whereas 60.235.45.114 appears to be a china telecom ip address). NAT'ing traffic over the Internet is probably not a good idea, unless you encapsulate it in a VPN.
[2024-01-07 06:50] <tomreyn> (and usually mobile networks do CGNAT - you would not be able to connect to a specific endpoint directly anyways)
[2024-01-07 06:59] <tomreyn> xxy: please choose where to discuss this: here or in #linux or in #networking - thanks.
[2024-01-07 07:00] <xxy> tomreyn: sorry, that ip is not my VPS IP. my VPS IP is "69.165.76.202" ,
[2024-01-07 07:02] <xxy> tomreyn: and i notice my VPS no direct public IP , it's a private address when i use "ip a " in that host
[2024-01-07 07:03] <tomreyn> xxy: you provided two ip addresses above, which one is to be replaced by "69.165.76.202", and which one is "VPS A" and "VPS B"? (we don't strictly need to know the IP addresses, just the architecture, unless you'd like someone helping test things).
[2024-01-07 07:04] <xxy> tomreyn: the relay VPS address is "69.165.76.202" that port is "1080" ,
[2024-01-07 07:05] <tomreyn> so that would be "VPS A"
[2024-01-07 07:05] <xxy> tomreyn: yes
[2024-01-07 07:07] <xxy> tomreyn: the problem is my client can't connect VPS A  which display connect refuse . then i check port with "nc -vz ip:port" ,it can't connect success
[2024-01-07 07:10] <tomreyn> xxy: a TCP connection from your client to VPS A's 1080/tcp can only succeed if the connection from VPS A to VPS B' tcp/1080 can be established and something is actually listening on this port on "VPS B"
[2024-01-07 07:11] <tomreyn> maybe discussing this in #networking was actually the better choice, because you may first want to get a better idea of how this network should be designed properly.
[2024-01-07 07:12] <tomreyn> what you're doing there might work, but it's most likely not a good setup, and - i guess - not what you really want.
[2024-01-07 07:15] <xxy> tomreyn: my application is xray , xray client is my pc ,and xray server locate on B VPS , and A VPS relay traffic from client request to B VPS for accelerating net speed. this is all.
[2024-01-07 07:22] <tomreyn> xxy: i'm not sure what you mean by xray, possibly jfrog's? are any of these systems actually running ubuntu?
[2024-01-07 07:22] <xxy> tomreyn: xray is a proxy which can bypass GFW,
[2024-01-07 07:23] <tomreyn> i see
[2024-01-07 07:23] <xxy> tomreyn: https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core
[2024-01-07 07:27] <tomreyn> xxy: i just looked at this, but i don't think i understand how the protocols or server works. there's a good chance someone in #networking will be more familiar with either this approach, or another one for what you're trying to achieve.
[2024-01-07 07:29] <xxy> tomreyn: do you mean talking in #networking?
[2024-01-07 07:30] <tomreyn> xxy: yes
[2024-01-07 07:31] <tomreyn> because this is hardly ubuntu related really. this software is not packaged in ubuntu and most people here won't be familiar with it.

[2024-01-07 09:11] <anotheryou> tomreyn: luks seemed difficult to install just for my partition too :/
[2024-01-07 09:11] <anotheryou> but thanks for the info
[2024-01-07 09:26] <nshire> is there any logical reason as to why gparted is included in the usb livedisk, but NOT the full desktop install?
[2024-01-07 09:26] <nshire> seems like an odd choice to me
[2024-01-07 09:38] <raxor2k> I would gladly pay someone here 10 or 15usd to setup a mailcow server on my droplet.. this is hell of a pain
[2024-01-07 09:49] <anotheryou> ough, found a tutorial how to encrypt a partition with the ubuntu installer but the ubuntu installer does not seem to have the option to create encrypted partitions anymore :(
[2024-01-07 09:50] <anotheryou> stuck on this step: "[after setting up a 300mb /boot in the partition manager], with the rest of the space make an encrypted volume. This will create a single LV partition. Modify it to be the selected root / partition. Saying it differently, hit the "change" button on /dev/mapper/sdaX_crypt and set the mount point to /"
[2024-01-07 09:51] <nshire> yeah what happened to the luks page
[2024-01-07 09:51] <anotheryou> I guess it should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/qNDcIkP.png
[2024-01-07 09:51] <anotheryou> but it seems "simplified" to this: https://i.imgur.com/iihlIw4.png

[2024-01-07 09:54] <raxor2k> if somebody is interested in setting up mail server for me for 10usd, contact in private msg
[2024-01-07 09:55] <respawn> raxor2k: just use ubuntu server and read the online manuals how to do it
[2024-01-07 09:55] <anotheryou> thank you nshire. it shouldn't be that complicated, but that guide looks straight forward at least :)
[2024-01-07 09:56] <anotheryou> still tempted to just kill windows not to deal with this hmmm...
[2024-01-07 09:56] <respawn> raxor2k: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-mail-server-on-ubuntu/
[2024-01-07 09:58] <anotheryou> nshire: ugh no, don't really want to touch efi :( hmmm...
[2024-01-07 09:58] <raxor2k> respawn: i will try, once again
[2024-01-07 09:59] <anotheryou> I think I'll do the unsecure home encrypion
[2024-01-07 09:59] <anotheryou> seems at least doable
[2024-01-07 09:59] <anotheryou> for me
[2024-01-07 10:00] <nshire> efi system partition isn't a big deal
[2024-01-07 10:00] <nshire> it can be rewritten if broken
[2024-01-07 10:00] <nshire> as long as you don't lose any encryption keys
[2024-01-07 10:01] <anotheryou> haha, that sounds... safe
[2024-01-07 10:01] <anotheryou> I'll do the insecure home encryption and call it a day
[2024-01-07 10:01] <anotheryou> I think it technically fulfills my works requirements
[2024-01-07 10:01] <anotheryou> and if they have nobody to set up linux for me that's their problem
[2024-01-07 10:01] <raxor2k> respawn: i have my own domain inside domeneshop.no, and i can point a DNS to my droplet inside digital ocean, do i need to install bind9 ?
[2024-01-07 10:04] <nshire> anotheryou, do you have important data you want to keep on the drive
[2024-01-07 10:07] <anotheryou> nshire: kinda: a windows installation/license I intended to keep (with no data in it yet, fresh laptop)
[2024-01-07 10:08] <nshire> license should be auto tied to the mobo if it was connected to the internet
[2024-01-07 10:14] <anotheryou> I guess, yes
[2024-01-07 10:15] <anotheryou> yea maybe I just wipe windows and do the full disk install...
[2024-01-07 10:15] <anotheryou> great, my fresh ubuntu doesn't get past starting gdm.service on boot. love this
[2024-01-07 10:15] <anotheryou> sorry, got a bit grumpy XD
[2024-01-07 10:15] <anotheryou> maybe I just do the full install and see where that gets me
[2024-01-07 10:16] <anotheryou> was just curious to test win11 and maybe use it privately a bit
[2024-01-07 11:27] <anotheryou> ok, somehow managed with popos :)
[2024-01-07 11:27] <anotheryou> did have to fix the boatloader though XD
[2024-01-07 11:28] <anotheryou> do you happen to know if I can re-enable bitlocker in windows after setting up my linux partition?
[2024-01-07 11:37] <ravage> both, popos and windows are offtopic here
[2024-01-07 11:41] <anotheryou> well the windows question is a generic one and just as true for ubuntu. And I wonder if it would affect ubuntu.
[2024-01-07 11:41] <anotheryou> but ok, I'll head out :)
[2024-01-07 11:41] <anotheryou> thanks anyways
[2024-01-07 11:45] <Phaelos> ubuntu sucks, and so does its community. sorry for the bad news
[2024-01-07 12:00] <Miroboru> I want to migrate some system currently using libpam_ldap to sssd. I have successfully set up a client using sssd from scratch, but I am unsure how to safely move a server already running libpam_ldap to sssd. Which services should I stop, what packages should be uninstalled and in which order for instance. Anyone has a good pointer to some resources on this?

[2024-01-07 12:56] <raxor2k> im asking for the last time, before im going to fiverr/upwork: someome who wants to set up mail server on my droplet for 10usd ?
[2024-01-07 12:56] <EriC^^> raxor2k: this isnt the place for such requests
[2024-01-07 12:57] <Miroboru> lotuspsychje: Not really, that is just for installing sssd on a clean system. I have now installed and set up sssd, including chanding nsswhich.conf to read passwd: files sss ... and so on. It is still authenticating using pam_ldap though, not sssd_pam as on the machine set up from scratch
[2024-01-07 12:58] <Miroboru> I find this really weird - I though nsswhich.conf was the only placed where this is set...
[2024-01-07 12:59] <raxor2k> EriC^^ :  fine, upwork it is

[2024-01-07 16:38] <Kartagis> hi
[2024-01-07 16:39] <Kartagis> how is it possible to remove "Try or Install Ubuntu" and such from grub?
[2024-01-07 16:39] <Menzador> Kartagis: for what purpose would you want that?
[2024-01-07 16:39] <ravage> that option only exists on the live images and not on installed systems
[2024-01-07 16:40] <Kartagis> ravage: on my installed system, it does exist.
[2024-01-07 16:40] <Menzador> Also what ravage said - when the installer runs the grub-install and update-grub scripts it will detect and automatically name what's there
[2024-01-07 16:40] <Kartagis> Menzador: I want to directly boot into my installed system.
[2024-01-07 16:41] <Menzador> Is your live media removed from your computer system?
[2024-01-07 16:41] <ravage> a default Ubuntu install does not have that entry
[2024-01-07 16:41] <ravage> make sure you do not boot from the install media
[2024-01-07 16:41] <tomreyn> after installation, ubuntu asks you to remove the installation media. maybe you missed this step.
[2024-01-07 17:13] <FKAShinobi> Is there a messenger client that supports slack, discord, irc, matrix, meta messenger?
[2024-01-07 17:13] <ravage> i think that is offtopic here. but you can use all those protocols with matrix bridges
[2024-01-07 17:14] <ravage> bleeper cloud offer that as a paid service i think
[2024-01-07 17:14] <FKAShinobi> ok, nothing in the repos though?  (22.04)
[2024-01-07 17:15] <ravage> i dont think so
[2024-01-07 17:15] <FKAShinobi> thanks
[2024-01-07 17:39] <telgareith> I miss the days when you got to choose what software gets installed during OS installation.
[2024-01-07 17:59] <lotuspsychje> telgareith: you can pick a minimal option at setup and install your wanted packages later?
[2024-01-07 18:00] <ravage> I think that was just a statementÂ

[2024-01-07 20:32] <marcopolo> my system starts becoming crazy after i run a game on ubuntu with the drivers installed
[2024-01-07 20:32] <marcopolo> for an example the whole desktop freezes to the point where i cant reach tty
[2024-01-07 20:32] <marcopolo> Im not sure what causes the bug
[2024-01-07 20:36] <marcopolo> do you think it might be because i didnt process vulkan shaders ?
[2024-01-07 20:37] <Frostly> marcopolo: what games are you running
[2024-01-07 20:38] <marcopolo> warframe
[2024-01-07 20:45] <marcopolo> I dont know if it has any inpact but i might have processed 30% of the shaders with my cpu because i forgot that i didnt have the gpu graphics installed
[2024-01-07 22:29] <austint> Hello. I am new to Ubuntu Support. There has been an issue with Ubuntu 23.10 that I can't seem to figure out. It's probably a bug related to the Gnome Desktop + Wayland + Nvidia more than likely. Whenever my laptop wakes from being inactive the gnome desktop UI is all broken with icons not rendering and the overview not working at all. The only way to fix it is by logging out and logging back in which really hurts my
[2024-01-07 22:29] <austint> productivity. I have a screenshot of what I see if it's useful.
[2024-01-07 22:30] <rbox> sounds like you should file a bug report
[2024-01-07 22:37] <austint> I'll look into doing that rbox.

[2024-01-08 00:00] <Laix> guys, there is a networking freak in my neighborhood,,,last year he said if he wants, he can see and learn whatever I do on my pc,,,mails, surfings,chattings...  /  I didn't believe him first...but then everyday he told me whatever I did on my pc in all details and I got surprised and also annoyed../ then I thought he could do all that probably using a screenmonitoring-like thing (maybe a remotely installed hidden app...etc... OR  he was not monitoring my
[2024-01-08 00:00] <Laix> screen but using a way which could enable to read all my network packages because I was using WIFI on my pc to connect to my smartphones internet via hotspot....and I was using windows 10...////  recently I decided to abandon windows and installed puppy linux on pc, before that I formatted both my pc and phone,,,I'm not using Wifi on my pc anymore, instead I'm using USB tethering to my smartphones...and...when I saw him recently...I said "come man, I dare you,
[2024-01-08 00:00] <Laix> now try to penetrate my pc again and tell me what I am doing on my pc again if you are able to.../ after only 1 week, he came and told me everything what I have been doing on my pc again!....GUYS!....DO YOU have any idea HOW He CAN DO all THAT? I asked him but he never reveals his skills and knowledge...
[2024-01-08 00:02] <WaV> He either knows your WiFi password, has something connected to your network, or works for the ISP.

[2024-01-08 00:51] <Laix> <leftyfb> ok man, thanks but I just need to ask and learn a lot about it
[2024-01-08 00:51] <leftyfb> Laix: since your issue has nothing to do with ubuntu, this isn't the appropriate channel to discuss it. Try #security
[2024-01-08 00:53] <Laix> maybe the reason is about my OS...maybe if I install Ubuntu, will be more secure...please consider that man
[2024-01-08 00:54] <leftyfb> Laix: your issue is unlikely to be the OS
[2024-01-08 00:54] <leftyfb> Laix: seek help in #securty. Good luck
[2024-01-08 00:54] <Laix> <leftyfb> right...thanks everyone...

[2024-01-08 01:33] <bray90820> Why after a few minutes  with some 2.4 ghz mice do Ineed to click the mouse to get it to respond
[2024-01-08 01:33] <arraybolt3> bray90820: Probably a power-saving feature of the mouse.
[2024-01-08 01:34] <bray90820> arraybolt3: Any way you know to disable that
[2024-01-08 01:34] <arraybolt3> it's hardware-specific AFAIK.
[2024-01-08 01:34] <arraybolt3> So the easiest way to disable it is... *ba-dum-tiss* use a different mouse :D
[2024-01-08 01:35] <arraybolt3> I have a Logitech trackball that does something *similar* but it's smart enough to check and see if there's movement every so often. Uses low power, also manages to detect when I start moving the trackball.

[2024-01-08 04:03] <dgutov> Looks like I got another crash during screen lock while having only two extensions installed: Ubuntu AppIndicators and "Light Shell" (one that consists of a .css file, basically). Before, I've ran okay for a day with built-in extensions only.

[2024-01-08 04:28] <SuperLag> I get there are ways to disable IPv6â¦ but what I don't get is why (when you have v6 *enabled) do updates never seem to work?
[2024-01-08 04:29] <rbox> what updates dont work
[2024-01-08 04:34] <SuperLag> trying to update my Ubuntu instance (in this case, it's WSL)
[2024-01-08 04:35] <SuperLag> even trying to set precedence to v4 connections, doesn't workâ¦ it's still going to v6
[2024-01-08 04:35] <rbox> what error do you get
[2024-01-08 04:37] <SuperLag> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/D4t57ZCnHK/
[2024-01-08 04:37] <rbox> looks like your DNS is resolving the ipv6 address
[2024-01-08 04:37] <rbox> but you have no route for it
[2024-01-08 04:43] <SuperLag> doh
[2024-01-08 04:43] <SuperLag> you just reminded me what I needed to do to fix it
[2024-01-08 06:16] <Oz__> hello world

[2024-01-08 07:37] <Guest10> what does it means "make executable"?
[2024-01-08 07:37] <Guest10> Looking for Debian (.deb) packages or Red Hat (.rpm) packages?

[2024-01-08 07:39] <EriC^^> there was a guy here that had a ntfs mft issue before and recommended to try chkdsk, wondering if that's you or a new person
[2024-01-08 07:39] <Guest10> it's in ntfs file system yes, but i used it for many months and works ok, just problem with long paths, so i have to cut/paste the file on desktop
[2024-01-08 07:40] <EriC^^> aha, and then how'd it stop working? is the hdd connected right now to ubuntu?
[2024-01-08 07:40] <Guest10> chkdsk is a windows command, do i have to use live usb of windws i guess to do CHKDSK
[2024-01-08 07:40] <Guest10> right?
[2024-01-08 07:40] <Guest10> EriC^^ i connected it but it doesn t work
[2024-01-08 07:41] <EriC^^> Guest10: can you connect it and run 'sudo parted -ls' and pastebin the output somewhere?
[2024-01-08 07:41] <Guest10> ravage i don't understand ./balenaEtcher-1.18.11-x64.AppImage

[2024-01-08 07:43] <EriC^^> i mean why waste time, it's in your interest and ours not to
[2024-01-08 07:44] <ravage> you are not in your downloads directory
[2024-01-08 07:44] <Guest10> i don't know if someone else have the same problems with hd

[2024-01-08 07:45] <EriC^^> Guest10: anyways try 'sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt' and please paste any errors you get
[2024-01-08 07:46] <Guest10> EriC^^ i don't waste time, i know that i have to create live usb of windows to do chkdsk, but startup disk creator of ubuntu doesn t recognize the iso of windows to create the live usb
[2024-01-08 07:48] <Guest10> https://pastebin.com/raw/Ugrg89rN
[2024-01-08 07:48] <Guest10> EriC^^
[2024-01-08 07:48] <EriC^^> Guest10: yes, i'm trying to see the problem itself, if you're the same guy then it'd be useful to know, then we wont bother with the initial problem and just continue with getting a windows iso thing going on, you see what i mean?
[2024-01-08 07:49] <Guest10> yes, in fact i asked for windows live usb
[2024-01-08 07:49] <Guest10> EriC^^
[2024-01-08 07:50] <EriC^^> yeah i know, but it could just be another easy problem
[2024-01-08 07:50] <EriC^^> anyways it's done

[2024-01-08 07:50] <ravage> run those in a terminal
[2024-01-08 07:50] <ravage> that requires that you downloaded  the file in your browser befire

[2024-01-08 07:59] <ravage> strange that it would not handle it really
[2024-01-08 08:01] <Guest10> EriC^^ i did what u said https://pastebin.com/raw/uy0F8hsF
[2024-01-08 08:02] <Guest10> ravage then, how can i create usb live of windows?
[2024-01-08 08:04] <Guest10> ravage the first image is when i try windows 11, the second one when i try to upload windows 11
[2024-01-08 08:05] <xxy> each time , after executing install command, it always appear this : https://paste.centos.org/view/eea00c74, how to resolve it ?
[2024-01-08 08:05] <EriC^^> Guest10: if you want an easy way to make a windows live usb, get a smaller windows version like win10, and extract it to a fat32 partition and boot it in uefi mode
[2024-01-08 08:06] <EriC^^> Guest10: do you have a win10 iso available right now?
[2024-01-08 08:07] <ravage> if you can find out which device is your USB thumb drive we can use another tool
[2024-01-08 08:08] <ravage> with the USB drive you want to install the windows iso on do: sudo fdisk -l | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-08 08:09] <Guest10> EriC^^ i downloaded iso of win 11 and win 10 from here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-installation-media-for-windows-99a58364-8c02-206f-aa6f-40c3b507420d
[2024-01-08 08:09] <Guest10> but none of them balena or startup dsk creator open
[2024-01-08 08:10] <EriC^^> Guest10: ok plug the usb in and run ravage 's command
[2024-01-08 08:10] <Guest10> ravage it's a classical 8 gb pen drive usb in fat32
[2024-01-08 08:11] <ravage> thats ok. we need the output of the command
[2024-01-08 08:14] <Guest10> https://pastebin.com/raw/m77PRPpa
[2024-01-08 08:15] <ravage> ok. now please send the full filename of the iso you downloaded

[2024-01-08 08:58] <ravage> thats: cd ~/Scaricati
[2024-01-08 08:59] <Guest0> that is the download directory
[2024-01-08 08:59] <ravage> correct
[2024-01-08 09:01] <Bish> ravage: that loks like it's for X
[2024-01-08 09:01] <Guest0> ok excuse me i had 2 windows of terminal opened, i wrong, i used the other one which is not in download directory
[2024-01-08 09:01] <Guest0> excuse me, i'm not so good on pc
[2024-01-08 09:02] <Guest0> ravage it s advancing
[2024-01-08 09:03] <Guest0> but i just wanna ask, how to do the same thing by graphical way?
[2024-01-08 09:03] <Guest0> such as by synaptic, package manager or by ubuntu software
[2024-01-08 09:03] <ravage> no idea
[2024-01-08 09:03] <Guest0> but graphical interface of woe-usb
[2024-01-08 09:03] <Guest0> it's so difficult by terminal
[2024-01-08 09:03] <Guest0> to do everything
[2024-01-08 09:03] <ravage> you only need to do this one time
[2024-01-08 09:04] <ravage> Bish: then you have to be more specific
[2024-01-08 09:04] <Guest0> woe-usb appears in ubuntu software, installed it but it didn t appear in list of apps
[2024-01-08 09:04] <ravage> this is the way
[2024-01-08 09:05] <Bish> ravage: well, current ubuntu is wayland, i don't know how i can be more specific
[2024-01-08 09:06] <Bish> setxkbmap de neo_qwertz: this used to work when ubuntu used X, now it doesn't
[2024-01-08 09:06] <ravage> Bish: i dont know. specifying your Ubuntu version? tell us that information about wayland in advance?
[2024-01-08 09:06] <Bish> and i want it to work

[2024-01-08 09:39] <Guest0> ravage it s finished
[2024-01-08 09:40] <Guest0> now?
[2024-01-08 09:40] <ravage> reboot and try to boot from it
[2024-01-08 09:41] <Guest0> ok if it doesn t work, i have to try with windows 10?
[2024-01-08 09:42] <Guest0> ravage
[2024-01-08 09:42] <ravage> just try this one first

[2024-01-08 10:12] <Guest0> in command prompt it doesn't appear hd connected so i can't do chkdsk /f
[2024-01-08 10:14] <ravage> That is off topic here
[2024-01-08 10:15] <Guest0> why?
[2024-01-08 10:15] <ravage> because it has nothing to do with Ubuntu
[2024-01-08 10:15] <Guest0> i have to create by ubuntu the live usb because i haven't any other pc with windows
[2024-01-08 10:15] <ravage> i think there is #windows
[2024-01-08 10:15] <Guest0> we were talking about that before
[2024-01-08 10:16] <ravage> about creating a usb bootable stick in Ubuntu yes
[2024-01-08 10:16] <ravage> we did that. the windows part of what you want to do is not Ubuntu related. so it is offtopic
[2024-01-08 10:16] <Guest0> ok but it's not a live usb of windows, i wrong the iso?
[2024-01-08 10:16] <Guest0> ok
[2024-01-08 10:16] <Guest0> thanls

[2024-01-08 10:35] <Guest0> external hd now has opened by file manager, but i don't know why, i just hope all data, file, photos, and music are at their places and i hope i haven't lost anything of my data

[2024-01-08 10:35] <Guest0> D:
[2024-01-08 11:04] <Guest0> ravage EriC^^ what could it have depended on?
[2024-01-08 11:04] <Guest0> Because in fact the hard disk has always worked well and has always been read well by Ubuntu apart from the fact that it didn't open files in long paths.
[2024-01-08 11:04] <Guest0> Now luckily it is working again and so at a quick glance it seems to me that everything is as before so perhaps I have not lost any data or files and I hope that in fact it is like this... but how can I prevent it from happening in the future that does not will you read it to me? Isn't it Ubuntu that has difficulty reading it and could ruin it? I
[2024-01-08 11:04] <Guest0> mean, I don't know if it depends on Ubuntu because now the other HD can't be read anymore and in fact on that one I still need to create the Windows live USB to see if it starts again
[2024-01-08 11:10] <Guest0> i'm using ubuntu since several months and i like it very much, so smart, free, useful and graphically simply, the problem when i have to use terminal because i ever prefer graphical methods because are more clear for me to uderstand what i'm doing and in which way i'm doing that.... otherwise i have fear that I'm afraid I'm doing something serious
[2024-01-08 11:10] <Guest0> wrong
[2024-01-08 12:08] <EriC^^> Guest0: if the iso booted you can go to additional options or something in the installer and choose command prompt
[2024-01-08 12:08] <EriC^^> this might help, https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/handy-windows-11-shortcut-could-save-you/
[2024-01-08 12:08] <Guest0> i did it EriC^^
[2024-01-08 12:09] <Guest0> but none option to read usb hd
[2024-01-08 12:20] <EriC^^> i see Guest0
[2024-01-08 12:23] <Guest0> EriC^^ i opened prompt command but it doesn't show me the external hd
[2024-01-08 12:23] <EriC^^> also in 'diskpart' ?
[2024-01-08 12:23] <Guest0> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZWcU7ueejb9ZeRM-U_xdf7J3MDePvrJ/view?usp=sharing, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTFXI5YU-4-q3lkOgise6UuMxsChXzy_/view?usp=sharing
[2024-01-08 12:23] <Guest0> i don't know what is diskpart
[2024-01-08 12:23] <Guest0> i just typed "dir"
[2024-01-08 12:24] <Guest0> i choosed prompt command
[2024-01-08 12:24] <EriC^^> it's for disk partitioning and stuff, shows the hdd, can partition and mount them etc
[2024-01-08 12:24] <Guest0> don't i have to type "dir"?
[2024-01-08 12:25] <EriC^^> i think also join ##windows here and ask them, they probably know better how to help
[2024-01-08 12:25] <Guest0> ok thanks a lot for all u do
[2024-01-08 12:25] <EriC^^> or it could be #windows
[2024-01-08 12:25] <Guest0> now external hd works again
[2024-01-08 12:25] <EriC^^> no problem
[2024-01-08 12:26] <Guest0> but i'm afraid it could doesn't work again and however i have to resolve on the other hd which aren't recognized by ubuntu
[2024-01-08 12:52] <Guest92> EriC^^ just a short question: which is the path of external drive when i open "manager windows from an app" by "open" command
[2024-01-08 12:52] <Guest92> the little windows to choose files and directories to let us understood
[2024-01-08 12:52] <Guest92> i can't find the pathway of external hd that now has read
[2024-01-08 12:53] <Guest92> i 'm on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
[2024-01-08 12:55] <EriC^> Guest92: i'm not really sure which program you're referring to, but lastly the external hd was /dev/sdb1 and it might be mounted somewhere and you can use that path, try "df" in a terminal it will show all mounted filesystems
[2024-01-08 12:55] <Guest92> all program
[2024-01-08 12:55] <EriC^> aha, try "lsblk"
[2024-01-08 12:56] <EriC^> look next to the ext hdd if there's a dir it's mounted under
[2024-01-08 12:59] <Guest92> https://pastebin.com/raw/JPqwECis
[2024-01-08 13:00] <Guest92> it does'n appear in the windows of file manager, i'm referring to the little file manager used when u have to select a file, open a file, upload a file
[2024-01-08 13:00] <Guest92> and so on

[2024-01-08 13:06] <EriC^^> looks 3tb
[2024-01-08 13:06] <EriC^^> if so it should be at /media/user/... in the window pop up

[2024-01-08 13:08] <Guest92> but in /media there isn't user folder
[2024-01-08 13:10] <EriC^^> odd
[2024-01-08 13:10] <Guest92> yes 3 TB
[2024-01-08 13:11] <Guest92> ok no problem, i will try tomorrow maybe
[2024-01-08 13:11] <Guest92> i just wanna create a backup on cloud o some files and i need to compress them
[2024-01-08 13:11] <Guest92> because of too much big
[2024-01-08 13:11] <Guest92> but i can't open them by winrar
[2024-01-08 13:18] <weedmic> cheers!  i have a properly formatted json file.  I need to make it one line.  I did this:  sed -e 's/^ *//' < file.txt | tr -d '\n' >out.txt - but I seem to have taken too much out.  when the file is flattened by hand, it works with my programme, when stripped with my sed command, it does not.  I did a diff command and it returns 1 with the entire text of the file.  any help is appreciated
[2024-01-08 13:20] <ravage> weedmic: try "  | jq -c . "
[2024-01-08 13:21] <weedmic> np
[2024-01-08 13:24] <weedmic> what is the "c" meanted to do?
[2024-01-08 13:25] <ravage> i think compress
[2024-01-08 13:25] <ravage> but maybe look at the manpage
[2024-01-08 13:27] <weedmic> tks - makes more sense that colour which was C not c
[2024-01-08 13:27] <weedmic> looks pretty much the same, but checking in programme now - tyvm
[2024-01-08 13:28] <weedmic> do you find jc better than tr?
[2024-01-08 13:28] <weedmic> i meant jq
[2024-01-08 13:32] <weedmic> ty - must leave atm

[2024-01-08 18:08] <GoyimDefense> The rabbi's name was Rabbi Yosef and he had become ever more enamored with the beautiful black woman, Shaquanda, who happened to be standing in the same neighborhood as him that day. He had never experienced such an immediate and extreme attraction to someone before. As his feelings for Shaquanda intensified, the rabbi became more brazen in expressing his admiration.
[2024-01-08 18:08] <GoyimDefense> On one occasion, he invited her back to his place and proceeded to stuff gefiltefish into her vagina before sticking his penis in to watch the gefiltefish ooze out around her labia. During their intercourse, the rabbi continuously whispered words of praise for Shaquanda; he cut no corners in his affection for her.
[2024-01-08 18:08] <GoyimDefense> The rabbi took every opportunity available to him to express his affection for Shaquanda. Every time he saw her, he showered her with lavish gifts of ice cream and chocolates from the fine local stores. He even touched her hands, face, and hair without hesitation. However, more than anything, his favorite activity was licking the scoops of ice cream that would still remain on her areolas even after their time apart.
[2024-01-08 18:09] <GoyimDefense> The rabbi loved her deeply, though tragically the romance was short-lived. After an intense display of passion between them, Shaquanda did not return anymore. The rabbi was left, sorrowful and alone.
[2024-01-08 18:09] <GoyimDefense> Although Rabbi Yosef felt that his life was ruined without Shaquanda, it was in that moment that he found solace in the ancient teachings of his faith. He now finds comfort in acknowledging the sanctity of their brief love affair and also revels in the beauty of the garden he has created in her memory.

[2024-01-09 02:49] <leftyfb> zeratul: I wouldn't recommend that though. There's a lot of applications are more up to date with snap and some are only available via snap

[2024-01-09 06:55] <codebam> how do I give a new user permissions to run firefox? I added it with `useradd new_user` and manually created a home directory

[2024-01-09 10:49] <hans__> "docker" is a "transitional package" to.. what?
[2024-01-09 11:05] <ogra_> hans__, "apt-cache show docker" ...  it should tell in the package description
[2024-01-09 11:05] <ogra_> (transitional packages usually do ..)
[2024-01-09 11:08] <lacrymology> I just ran out of space in /boot... how do I deal with that? I'll need to boot from media to resize, right?
[2024-01-09 11:09] <lacrymology> hm, gparted says there's like 230mb left
[2024-01-09 11:11] <HurstvilleGuy> does anyone have the code to install chrome ?
[2024-01-09 11:17] <HurstvilleGuy> got it.
[2024-01-09 11:30] <akik> lacrymology: remove old kernels that you don't need any more
[2024-01-09 11:34] <ogra_> but make sure to use apt for this, dont just delete files ...
[2024-01-09 11:34] <PeGaSuS> can I disable snap confinement for a specific application, like Firefox i.e?
[2024-01-09 11:35] <ogra_> nope
[2024-01-09 11:36] <ogra_> snap confinement is defined at package build time only, if the packager did not enable any interfaces (which are the things to allow circumventing confinement for defined parts of the system), you wont be able to turn it off ...
[2024-01-09 11:38] <ogra_> that said ... there are ways like i.e. bÃ­nd mounts to make stuff available to confined applications in their confined space
[2024-01-09 11:39] <PeGaSuS> I guess that I'll need to follow this method to use it as a deb package which allows me to directly import stuff from Chrome: https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/04/install-firefox-deb-ubuntu-22-04/
[2024-01-09 11:40] <ogra_> what do you want to import ? you can surely just copy things into the FF config dirs as you can without confinement
[2024-01-09 11:40] <ogra_> i'd not switch to a completely unsupported browser for just this ...
[2024-01-09 11:41] <PeGaSuS> on windows I can simply import data directly from Chrome to Firefox (passwords, etc). now, with snaps I just can't on Ubuntu
[2024-01-09 11:43] <ogra_> PeGaSuS, https://logmeonce.com/resources/transfer-passwords-from-chrome-to-firefox-2/
[2024-01-09 11:44] <ogra_> should work with the snapped firefox as well
[2024-01-09 11:44] <ogra_> (point 1 that is ... i.e. export from chrome to your home, then import from FF)
[2024-01-09 11:45] <PeGaSuS> nope. on the snap package the "Google Chrome" option doesn't appear
[2024-01-09 11:45] <ogra_> read the page ... point 1 only ...
[2024-01-09 11:47] <PeGaSuS> I want more data than only passwords. I want bookmarks and other stuff. this idea of "let's use snap for everything" is more cumbersome and more annoying than anything
[2024-01-09 11:48] <ogra_> well, once there was a security vulnerability in a browser and everyone lost their online banking account data to a scammer you might re-consider these words ð
[2024-01-09 11:50] <PeGaSuS> so, we should limit every user just because a handful of them are unable to protect themselves?
[2024-01-09 11:50] <ogra_> i'd personally not use unsnapped browsers for security relevant tasks anymore ... but it is your system indeed, install a deb based FF if you feel like, instructions are out there, but note that we can not support a deb based firefox here  ð
[2024-01-09 11:51] <ogra_> (or in any other official ubuntu support venues)
[2024-01-09 11:51] <ogra_> i'm sure there are similar methods as above for importing bookmarks, history and other stuff if you google a bit
[2024-01-09 11:54] <PeGaSuS> which only frustrates people because now we have to go into hoops that we previously didn't have to
[2024-01-09 11:54] <ogra_> file a bug ... i'm sure the mozilla guys would happily work with the snapd peaople to create a snap interface to allow direct imports
[2024-01-09 11:55] <ogra_> ... it just doesnt exist today ... and it wont if nobody tells them
[2024-01-09 11:58] <spinningCat> i dont know why ubuntu cannot connect wireless netork that i can connect with windos without problem
[2024-01-09 12:07] <PeGaSuS> the "bug" shouldn't be a bug because it worked before the move to snap. I'll install Firefox from the PPA, change PPA priority and done
[2024-01-09 12:08] <ogra_> better use the tarball ... the PPA is just for testing backports to old ubuntu releases, it will eventually go away
[2024-01-09 12:08] <ogra_> (so you might silently stop getting updates at some point)
[2024-01-09 14:41] <amcsi_> in Xubuntu how do I disable middle clicking on a window panel minimizing the window?
[2024-01-09 14:47] <pragmaticenigma> amcsi_: Right click on Panel > Panel preferences > Items > Window Buttons > Settings > Behaviour : Middle Click Action
[2024-01-09 14:48] <pragmaticenigma> amcsi_: There is also a #xubuntu channel where you will probably get answers XFCE desktop questions a little quicker. This channel is mostly volunteers running Ubuntu Desktop (with Gnome)

[2024-01-09 16:10] <AngryTom> I get sound stutter with 23.10 on VMware Fusion. Changing to X11 didn't help. Any ideas?
[2024-01-09 16:12] <Guest99> hi, I am running ubuntu-desktop 23.10. My CPU is amd r7 6800H. After installing google-chrome if I run it from command line, I can see endless repeated error messages: "ERROR:vulkan_swap_chain.cc(409)] Swapchain is suboptimal.". In chrome about:gpu, it shows webgpu is disabled. I am not sure if this is related. I did google, but don't find any
[2024-01-09 16:12] <Guest99> proper solutions yet. Maybe it's something related to my gpu driver. I am not sure.
[2024-01-09 16:14] <leftyfb> Guest99: can you try chromium and see if you have the same issue?  sudo apt install chromium-browser
[2024-01-09 16:15] <Guest99> thanks. I will try that now.
[2024-01-09 16:16] <Guest99> btw, it's installing from snap store. I don't like snap.
[2024-01-09 16:19] <leftyfb> Guest99: did you get the same issue with chromium?
[2024-01-09 16:21] <Guest99> leftyfb: I just tried chromium. It doesn't report the same error message. It outputs different error message. webgpu and Vulkan are disabled too. There are more features disabled in chromium. Which pastebin is preferred here? I can paste the error outputs. They are not endless repeated though.

[2024-01-09 16:28] <Guest99> I can not access reddit. It blocked my IP. No other websites do this, only reddit.

[2024-01-09 16:30] <Guest99> I think the answer is just a link points to reddit webpage. maybe I am wrong?
[2024-01-09 16:31] <leftyfb> Guest99: try the parameter and/or the options at the bottom
[2024-01-09 16:32] <Guest99> leftyfb: I tried "--gpu-active-vendor-id=0x1001", it doesn't work.
[2024-01-09 16:33] <Guest99> I am using amd r7 6800h. gpu: [Radeon 680M]
[2024-01-09 16:39] <Guest99> Should I install amd gpu driver from adm.com?
[2024-01-09 16:39] <Guest99> IÂ  mean amd.com. sorry, typo
[2024-01-09 16:40] <leftyfb> Guest99: did you try the options at the bottom of the link I gave you?
[2024-01-09 16:41] <Guest99> leftyfb: which option? I said I tried "--gpu-active-vendor-id=0x1001". it doesn't work.
[2024-01-09 16:42] <leftyfb> did you try enabling vulan in the chrome://flags/ ?
[2024-01-09 16:42] <Guest99> I just tried "--enable-features=Vulkan,webgpu", it doesn't work either. The post author said it didn't work.
[2024-01-09 16:43] <leftyfb> ok, then you might want to try different gpu drivers
[2024-01-09 16:43] <leftyfb> sorry, but I have almost no experience with AMD GPU drivers
[2024-01-09 16:43] <Guest99> leftyfb: No. I just checked chrome://flags/ in chromium. That page does not have "vulan" keyword.
[2024-01-09 16:44] <leftyfb> I meant vulkan
[2024-01-09 16:45] <Guest99> leftyfb: sure, thank you very much for your help. I will search how to install amd proprietary driver.
[2024-01-09 16:45] <leftyfb> !amd | Guest99
[2024-01-09 16:45] <ubottu> Guest99: On Ubuntu, AMD's official Linux graphics driver "amdgpu" is automatically loaded for matching hardware. Very old cards use driver "radeon" (r300, r600) instead. See the !man pages for X options, "modinfo -p <graphics-driver>" for kernel parameters. Both drivers are open source and integrate with MESA and !DRI. Drivers "amdgpu-pro", "fglrx" and "ati" are not supported here.
[2024-01-09 16:45] <Guest99> leftyfb: I just enabled "vulkan" in chrome://flags/. Nothing changed.

[2024-01-09 17:12] <ubottu> de-facto: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its official !flavors, please report it using the command Â« ubuntu-bug <package> Â» - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[2024-01-09 17:12] <de-facto> freshly installed 22.04
[2024-01-09 17:12] <leftyfb> de-facto: what release of ubuntu are you running?
[2024-01-09 17:12] <leftyfb> odd
[2024-01-09 17:15] <de-facto> i didnt even do anything to it and it already fails with default fresh setup out of the box
[2024-01-09 17:16] <Menzador> Wouldn't core20 be superseded already?
[2024-01-09 17:16] <leftyfb> I'm pretty sure it's there for backward compatibility
[2024-01-09 17:16] <leftyfb> de-facto: you can also try asking in #snappy
[2024-01-09 17:17] <Menzador> Fair. In the meantime, try `killall snap-store` and restart the app
[2024-01-09 17:17] <leftyfb> or just reboot
[2024-01-09 17:17] <de-facto> which app? "ubuntu software"?
[2024-01-09 17:17] <leftyfb> just reboot. see if it's still there
[2024-01-09 17:17] <de-facto> sigh
[2024-01-09 17:18] <Menzador> Yeah, a reboot will kill it too (but I'd argue that's like rebooting your computer to quit vi)
[2024-01-09 17:19] <leftyfb> de-facto: also, have you run all normal updates? I would recommend doing so from the command line:   sudo apt update ; sudo apt full-upgrade
[2024-01-09 17:20] <de-facto> yes i was fully up to date, had to close all windows, and interrupt my work to reboot because of snap now
[2024-01-09 17:20] <de-facto> now its gone
[2024-01-09 17:21] <leftyfb> it was probably a bug in the software center, not snap
[2024-01-09 17:21] <Menzador> Yeah, I've seen this a few times in snap-store myself
[2024-01-09 17:22] <leftyfb> Menzador: "snap store"?
[2024-01-09 17:22] <de-facto> i dont like it, every single time i have to deal with snap its because of problems
[2024-01-09 17:23] <de-facto> also i really hate that there is no browser in ubuntu just the snap package
[2024-01-09 17:23] <leftyfb> there is a browser. There's firefox
[2024-01-09 17:23] <de-facto> basically forcing users to use nsap
[2024-01-09 17:23] <leftyfb> provided directly by Mozilla
[2024-01-09 17:23] <de-facto> as snap yeah but not as normal package
[2024-01-09 17:23] <leftyfb> snap is a package system, similar to apt and yum
[2024-01-09 17:24] <leftyfb> it shouldn't matter how the package was installed
[2024-01-09 17:24] <leftyfb> de-facto: does firefox work for you?
[2024-01-09 17:24] <Guest99> hi, I am not sure if my chrome issue can be fixed by using X11. Is that recommended to use X11 for ubuntu-desktop 23.10? If so, is there a GUI way to switch to X11? thanks.
[2024-01-09 17:25] <de-facto> yes but its snap, hence not really integrated in the system
[2024-01-09 17:25] <leftyfb> de-facto: why do you need firefox "integrated in the system"?
[2024-01-09 17:25] <Menzador> leftyfb: Well, "Ubuntu Software" anyway. But yeah, I've had trouble with more recent versions of it, even in 23.10, and usually a restart or a process kill will flush it
[2024-01-09 17:26] <Menzador> Guest99: What issue are you having with Chrome?
[2024-01-09 17:26] <leftyfb> Guest99: https://fostips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/login-xorg-jammy.gif
[2024-01-09 17:27] <Menzador> !xy | Guest99
[2024-01-09 17:27] <ubottu> Guest99: The XY problem is when you need to do X, and you think you can use Y to do X, so you ask about how to do Y, when what you really should do is state what your X problem is. There may be a Z solution that is even better than Y, but nobody can suggest it if X is never mentioned.
[2024-01-09 17:27] <Guest99> Menzador: It endless outputs "ERROR:vulkan_swap_chain.cc(409)] Swapchain is suboptimal.". Webgpu is disabled.
[2024-01-09 17:27] <Guest99> Menzador: I have asked chrome issue here. no answer. That's why I am trying something else.
[2024-01-09 17:28] <Guest99> I am using amd r7 6800h.
[2024-01-09 17:28] <leftyfb> Guest99: no answer?
[2024-01-09 17:29] <Guest99> leftyfb: no solution? Sorry that I am not a native English speaker.
[2024-01-09 17:29] <leftyfb> !amd | Guest99
[2024-01-09 17:29] <ubottu> Guest99: On Ubuntu, AMD's official Linux graphics driver "amdgpu" is automatically loaded for matching hardware. Very old cards use driver "radeon" (r300, r600) instead. See the !man pages for X options, "modinfo -p <graphics-driver>" for kernel parameters. Both drivers are open source and integrate with MESA and !DRI. Drivers "amdgpu-pro", "fglrx" and "ati" are not supported here.
[2024-01-09 17:30] <Menzador> Guest99: I'm told this may be fixed in 118
[2024-01-09 17:30] <Guest99> I haven't tried to install amdgpu-pro driver yet. Because online articles do not recommend to use it.
[2024-01-09 17:31] <Guest99> Menzador: Do you mean chrome version? The latest one (I am currently running) is chrome 120.
[2024-01-09 17:32] <Menzador> https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3646633
[2024-01-09 17:32] <leftyfb> chromium-browser is at version 85
[2024-01-09 17:32] <Menzador> From upstream it looks like the whole thing's getting a replacement
[2024-01-09 17:33] <Guest99> So what can I do now? I can not live without a browser. I need to use chrome for my daily life.
[2024-01-09 17:38] <Guest99> I am OK as long as chrome stop printing "ERROR:vulkan_swap_chain.cc(409)] Swapchain is suboptimal." forever.
[2024-01-09 18:03] <arraybolt3> Guest99: What problem are the log lines causing? Is the browser failing to launch? Are you running out of disk space due to the logs being spammed?
[2024-01-09 18:04] <Guest99> OK, If I disable vulkan with "--disable-features=Vulkan", the error message will not be printed.
[2024-01-09 18:05] <Guest99> arraybolt3: It does not cause anything yet. I just don't want to see the lines are getting printed forever and occupy the terminal scroll buffers. I just feel bad for the terminal and my laptop somehow.
[2024-01-09 18:05] <leftyfb> Guest99: why are you running chrome from a terminal anyway?
[2024-01-09 18:06] <Guest99> leftyfb: I run everything from terminal. I want to see the stdout. If it keeps printing something, I will not run it. Either fix it or switch to another app. Error message is fine to me, but I can't accept forever endless printing.
[2024-01-09 18:08] <pragmaticenigma> Guest99: The "forever" printing is because your actions relaunch the things that is causing the message to appear. What it is telling you is that your browser is trying to use 3D acceleration to render the web page your are visiting, but the graphics drivers are not supporting it. If you think that is bad, you really should avoid running `tail -f /var/log/syslog`
[2024-01-09 18:10] <Guest99> pragmaticenigma: thanks for the explanation. I don't get what the words "your actions relaunch the things" mean. I don't relaunch things. and I never run `tail -f /var/log/syslog`.
[2024-01-09 18:13] <pragmaticenigma> Guest99: As your browse the web, the action of scrolling up and down the page, clicking a link to a new page, the javascript loading additional elements to the page as you interact with it. Those are all initially sent to the Vulkan handler to try and perform the rendering using 3d acceleration. The warning is there to inform that a secondary option has been used inplace of the preferred. Developers are very lazy and during the building
[2024-01-09 18:13] <pragmaticenigma> of an application throw thousands of messages to the aplication's log. Often it's to trace an issue, and when the issue is resolved, they don't remove the messages because things are now working, why risk breaking it again.
[2024-01-09 18:14] <Guest99> pragmaticenigma: not really. The error message keeps printing directly after launching chrome. I don't do anything yet.
[2024-01-09 18:15] <Guest99> Without doing anything, just keep chrome open, the error messages are printing forever.
[2024-01-09 18:15] <pragmaticenigma> Guest99: I'm not about to go into the hundreds of thousands of things that could trigger that particular handler. Program routines are reused and referenced throughout a program. It could be used to draw the address bar at the top of the window for anyone knows
[2024-01-09 18:16] <Guest99> ok, I just want to get rid of those messages. that's all. thanks a lot for the explanation.
[2024-01-09 18:17] <pragmaticenigma> even blink the cursor. The authors of the application did not intend for you to open that in terminal. Its being done so when you ask for support, you can provide information from the applications own debugger, which will include that information.
[2024-01-09 18:17] <pragmaticenigma> you can't get rid of the message. you can turn off the feature, which then leads to a less than ideal experience. In your case, the CPU is now likely rendering the web pages, instead of the GPU, which takes up other system resources
[2024-01-09 18:19] <Guest99> But I think webgpu never works in chrome + amd. I just checked my other laptops with amd cpu, the vulkan and webgpu in chrome are also disabled. I never saw it's working.
[2024-01-09 18:20] <Guest99> I mean in linux. Other laptops are running debian though.
[2024-01-09 18:26] <pragmaticenigma> Guest99: before making unfounded accusations like that, I'd suggest you read up and become knowledgeable on the topic. All these things, Vulkan, WebGPU and more are under active development. Always improving and fixing. What was true yesterday is only an update away from being untrue today
[2024-01-09 18:27] <newbieserver> Running Ubuntu server 22.04.03 LTS - I am replacing two data drives (hdd) - but after doing so the computer only boots into emergency mode. more details are here https://pastebin.com/LNjmS13c
[2024-01-09 18:28] <Guest99> pragmaticenigma: well, before posting, I checked https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status, it shows webgpu is not supported in linux. I don't know if other people make it work or not. but I never see it's working in my laptops.
[2024-01-09 18:29] <newbieserver> So as the pastebin says after commenting out all the data hard drives in /etc/fstab - the computer boots normally
[2024-01-09 18:30] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: where did you source the UUIDs from?
[2024-01-09 18:30] <leftyfb> Guest99: wait, so you read that webgpu isn't supported in linux. You know how to disable it and the messages. So what exactly are you looking for again?
[2024-01-09 18:30] <newbieserver> pragmaticenigma, I used ssh to connect via my Fedora terminal and ran $sudo blkid
[2024-01-09 18:31] <newbieserver> brb sorry
[2024-01-09 18:35] <newbieserver> so this is my plan I am going to reconnect one data drive at a time - if computer boots normally I will add the drive back to /etc/fstab
[2024-01-09 18:35] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: Are you running Ubuntu or Fedora?
[2024-01-09 18:35] <newbieserver> Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS server
[2024-01-09 18:36] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: okay, you need to attch the drives without the defined UUID, and look up the new UUID values that are assigned in the new system
[2024-01-09 18:36] <newbieserver> that's my plan
[2024-01-09 18:36] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: you just said you copied them over from Fedora... which won't work
[2024-01-09 18:38] <Guest99> leftyfb: What I am looking for it's to get rid of those error messages. In my first post, I said I didn't know what causes the error message, it might because of gpu driver. I am not a browser or gpu developer, so I don't know the details. After searching and trials, in the end, I figured out those error messages are caused by vulkan is enabled in
[2024-01-09 18:38] <Guest99> google-chrome-stable by default, but webgpu doesn't work. So to fix it, either enable webgpu somehow or disable vulkan. I just knew all these information in the end. So in the beginning of my previous posts, I have no ideas how to get rid of those error messages.
[2024-01-09 18:39] <newbieserver> well I had used an ssh terminal on Fedora to connect to the Ubuntu server - and ran blkid on the Ubuntu server so I think the UUIDs are valid
[2024-01-09 18:39] <newbieserver> but I will let you know
[2024-01-09 18:39] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: okay you're confusing everything with the involvement and mentioning of Fedora
[2024-01-09 18:39] <newbieserver> ok .. sorry
[2024-01-09 18:40] <newbieserver> my apologies - when I get the emergency mode thing I'm at a loss
[2024-01-09 18:41] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: It's because you're not being patient and jumping to just trying things before anyone has a chance to help you figure out what it is you are doing
[2024-01-09 18:42] <leftyfb> Guest99: [13:04:02] <Guest99> OK, If I disable vulkan with "--disable-features=Vulkan", the error message will not be printed.
[2024-01-09 18:42] <leftyfb> Guest99: do you still need help?
[2024-01-09 18:45] <Guest99> leftyfb: no. I am just being polite to answer people's doubts. It's 03:00am. I really need to sleep. But since people keep talking to me, so I am replying. Sorry that if anything I said is unclear. I am not a native english speaker.
[2024-01-09 18:45] <newbieserver> sorry pragmaticenigma ... too much caffeine today
[2024-01-09 18:46] <ioria> Guest99, have you tried (on a test machine) to update mesa, vulkan et. etc. with not standard versions ?
[2024-01-09 18:47] <Guest99> ioria: how to update mesa, vulkan with not standard versions? I don't really get it. thanks.
[2024-01-09 18:47] <ioria> Guest99, with a PPA, for example
[2024-01-09 18:48] <pragmaticenigma> ioria: 3rd party PPAs move this out of our ability to support them. Please don't suggest that
[2024-01-09 18:48] <ioria> i know, that's why i said 'on a test machine'
[2024-01-09 18:48] <pragmaticenigma> newbieserver: What is needed from you is some information about what you are trying to do. a listing of the block devices on your systen. ideally a proposed fstab file that you would like to use.
[2024-01-09 18:49] <Guest99> ioria: I haven't tried that. So far, I am happy to see those error messages are gone. I think I will simply live with it and keep updating the system. Hopefully, one day, vulkan and webgpu will work in linux. :)
[2024-01-09 18:51] <pragmaticenigma> Guest99: Or launch the application as the developers intended. The launcher probably does all that for you to find you the best experience.
[2024-01-09 18:54] <Guest99> pragmaticenigma: thanks for the tip. I just checked "/usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop". It's simply "Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U". No extra flags. I think it's the same as calling google-chrome-stable. I am just used to using command line launching. I will consider your suggestion. Thanks a lot.
[2024-01-09 18:55] <ioria> the point is, i guess, if  chrome is using hardware acceleration or not, right ?
[2024-01-09 18:55] <Guest99> for me, I just don't want to see those errors.
[2024-01-09 18:56] <leftyfb> Guest99: [13:04:02] <Guest99> OK, If I disable vulkan with "--disable-features=Vulkan", the error message will not be printed.
[2024-01-09 18:56] <Guest99> ioria: is your browser using webgpu? does it work in your place?
[2024-01-09 18:59] <ioria> Guest99, you mean this e.g. : https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webgpu#webgpu_backdrop
[2024-01-09 18:59] <newbieserver> OK I checked the UUIDs for the data drives against the values in /etc/fstab and they are correct so all drives are connected and the error messages vanished. Sorry to have wasted your time.
[2024-01-09 19:00] <dob1> hi, any idea why alacritty is not defined in terminfo ?
[2024-01-09 19:00] <dob1> alacritty installed via snap
[2024-01-09 19:01] <ioria> Guest99, it works fine in ff
[2024-01-09 19:01] <Guest99> ioria: sorry, no. I mean if webgpu Hardware accelerated in your browser or not. I checked my firefox. it's not hardware accelerated by default. anyway.
[2024-01-09 19:01] <pragmaticenigma> dob1: It may have something to do with it being installed as a snap. but overall, this is a volunteer channel, you'd have to ask the maintainers of terminfo why it's not included in their definitions.
[2024-01-09 19:02] <pragmaticenigma> dob1: or file a bug with Ubuntu to get things raised up the channels
[2024-01-09 19:02] <pragmaticenigma> !bug | dob1
[2024-01-09 19:02] <ubottu> dob1: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its official !flavors, please report it using the command Â« ubuntu-bug <package> Â» - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[2024-01-09 19:02] <Guest99> I gotta sleep now. thank you all for the help.
[2024-01-09 19:04] <dob1> pragmaticenigma: ok thanks
[2024-01-09 19:40] <SuperLag> If you're installing Server, and you pick the option to install third-party drivers, does it take care of blacklisting the nouveau drivers for you? or do you still have to that yourself later?
[2024-01-09 19:43] <pragmaticenigma> SuperLag: I haven't seen a need to block any driver when proprietary/3rd party ones are installed. If you have a system that is preferring the opensource over the 3rd party drivers, I would investigate that as a bug, or that the hardware lookup for the 3rd party driver does not include the target device.
[2024-01-09 21:34] <dutly> is it safe to disable secureboot for dual booting because when i dual boot ubuntu and windows , windows will go into recovery when i try to boot it again
[2024-01-09 21:34] <dutly> i think its because secureboot
[2024-01-09 21:35] <dutly> nvm. i think im just going to use ubuntu only
[2024-01-09 21:35] <pragmaticenigma> dutly: It's a matter of opinion. I do not have secure boot enabled on my machines, as they do not travel anywhere. And I have a private residence. If it was a laptop that I took different places, then I would enable it
[2024-01-09 21:36] <dutly> ok
[2024-01-09 21:36] <dutly> what is secure boot for anyways
[2024-01-09 21:37] <pragmaticenigma> dutly: mostly to help identify if something has altered the machine to load root kits, or other pre-boot malware
[2024-01-09 21:37] <dutly> oh ok
[2024-01-09 21:38] <dutly> im just going to leave it on then and try xubuntu only. windows is kind of boring
[2024-01-09 21:56] <AngryTom> Why not Gnome?
[2024-01-09 21:59] <pragmaticenigma> AngryTom: To whom or what are you asking about?
[2024-01-09 21:59] <bprompt> dutly:  you can disable it, sure, will work fine in dual-boot
[2024-01-09 22:00] <AngryTom> @dutly
[2024-01-09 22:00] <pragmaticenigma> AngryTom: That's not a support topic. What a person chooses for their system is a personal decision.
[2024-01-09 22:00] <pragmaticenigma> AngryTom: Also Gnome is a Desktop Environment, not an Operating System
[2024-01-09 22:01] <AngryTom> so is Xfce
[2024-01-09 22:01] <AngryTom> are you a noob?

[2024-01-09 22:10] <sem> I am trying to enable the Ubuntu "Startup Sound" from days of old on my lubuntu system. Many online guides say that the soundfile is something like /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/desktop-login.ogg However I don't have this file, perhaps since I am on lubuntu. Is there an easy way to download this file or other files that should be present on a default ubuntu install?
[2024-01-09 22:12] <pragmaticenigma> sem, You can browse around http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ to see if it's in there, or just download one of the ISO images and extract the sound file from there.
[2024-01-09 22:15] <sem> where would I find it in the iso, or would I have to install it / spin up the live cd?
[2024-01-09 22:17] <pragmaticenigma> sem: The ISO should have the same directory structure as an installed system. I would expect to find it in the same location.
[2024-01-09 22:18] <sem> ok cool thanks
[2024-01-09 22:28] <sem> I found them here, thanks! http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/ubuntu-sounds/
[2024-01-09 22:36] <pragmaticenigma> nice!
[2024-01-09 23:01] <dutly> does mantic use wire or pulseaudio? which one?
[2024-01-09 23:01] <guiverc> sem, you didn't mention release (that I can see), but ubuntu-sounds exists for all releases ; https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/all/ubuntu-sounds/filelist shows what's in it for noble (my release)
[2024-01-09 23:03] <guiverc> dutly, flavors can vary as i understand it; some switched to pipewire for 23.04 & later, but I'm not sure all did for 23.10
[2024-01-09 23:03] <dutly> ah ok
[2024-01-09 23:04] <dutly> trying to figure out if i should install easyeffects or pulseeffects
[2024-01-09 23:04] <dutly> but im on xubuntu so not a ubuntu question
[2024-01-09 23:05] <pragmaticenigma> dutly: If you run `ps -e | grep pipewire` and get results, you have pipewire running on your system
[2024-01-09 23:05] <dutly> ok thanks

[2024-01-10 02:04] <kotgc> Hi, is this the Ubuntu channel?
[2024-01-10 02:05] <kotgc> Iâm stuck in my iPhone as Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS is booting to a black screen.
[2024-01-10 02:06] <kotgc> Iâve tried all these troubleshooting steps: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2494247&p=14174239#post14174239

[2024-01-10 02:07] <sem> but I was able to download it from an old archive :)

[2024-01-10 02:08] <guiverc> https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/ubuntu-sounds should be there ; contains these files - https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/all/ubuntu-sounds/filelist
[2024-01-10 02:09] <guiverc> Lubuntu doesn't support 20.04 (3 years for flavors), but Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is still supported (with LXQt an alternate desktop)..   I can't recall if I added sound files to this box or not...   i'll do a quick search
[2024-01-10 02:11] <guiverc> ubuntu-sounds isn't installed here??  (I'm using Lubuntu/LXQt.. but my box is heavily modified & may have been pulled in with other stuff I added post-install)
[2024-01-10 03:14] <webchat79> Does anyone experienced the dist-package outdated issue for cloud-init feature, since netplan requires single root permission, but the cloud-init feature NETPLAN_CONFIG_ROOT_READ_ONLY is still disabled in latest dist-package of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, though the version of cloud-init is 23.3.3.
[2024-01-10 04:12] <RickNMortadela> Often people will ask, "Why does the Negro do this?" or "Why did the Negro do that?" It is pretty much akin to asking why dogs bark, why cats climb trees, or why birds fly. They just do â their primitive brains are hard-wired in a manner that is incompatible with Human logic.
[2024-01-10 04:12] <RickNMortadela> God only knows what really goes on inside the chimpâs brain-pan, but we can identify certain behaviors that seem to be consistent among the species:
[2024-01-10 04:12] <RickNMortadela> 1) "LOOK-A-ME!" This is the basic 24-hour a day / 7 days a week behavior that the Negro employs to get attention. This is basically why Negroes wear the most idiotic outfits, have 10 pounds of fake "bling" around their necks, blare their stereos, talk at the top of their voice at all times, etc., etc. It is all a ploy to get noticed and stand out from the other members of the Chimp Pack in an attempt to get food, money, or sex.
[2024-01-10 04:12] <RickNMortadela> 2) "GIBS-MUH!" Now that the Negro has your attention, it will attempt to extort spare change, get free Government Cheese, FEMA checks, or even the rims off of your car. The Negro, suffering from an inferiority complex by nature, is also perpetually lazy and stupid, and therefore blames all of its problems on Whitey â seeking free handouts as a never-ending form of compensation for imagined wrongdoings.
[2024-01-10 04:12] <RickNMortadela> 3) "MUH-DIK" This is the primary driver of Negro behavior. Everything to a Negro revolves around sex â whether itâs with an unwilling victim, farm animals, patio furniture, a Brother on the "Down-Low", or a female member of itâs own species. Negroes have an unusually strong sex drive because basically the species would have died out 10âs of thousands of years ago if they weren't genetically programmed to screw even the uglies
[2024-01-10 04:12] <RickNMortadela> t, most disgusting member of the opposite sex in response to Natureâs demand to perpetuate the species.
[2024-01-10 04:23] <mybalzitch> oh hey, thats against the starlink AUP

[2024-01-10 07:21] <Kangarooo> what is swap name? swapfile? grep swap /etc/fstab
[2024-01-10 07:21] <Kangarooo> /dev/mapper/vgkubuntu-swap_1 none            swap    sw
[2024-01-10 07:21] <Kangarooo> in on kubutnu 22.04.3 shows swap
[2024-01-10 07:21] <Kangarooo> i did swapoff -a and now cant find what is correct name for swap file
[2024-01-10 07:21] <Kangarooo> so i would use the same name not like in tutorials swapfile. maybe now its called just swap?
[2024-01-10 07:27] <Kangarooo> did sudo swapoff -a now cant do sudo swapon /swapfile
[2024-01-10 07:27] <Kangarooo> maybe different file name?
[2024-01-10 07:28] <CosmicDJ> Kangarooo: swapon -a ?
[2024-01-10 07:30] <Kangarooo> yes thx CosmicDJ . now swapon --show
[2024-01-10 07:30] <Kangarooo> NAME      TYPE      SIZE USED PRIO
[2024-01-10 07:30] <Kangarooo> /dev/dm-2 partition 1,9G   0B   -2
[2024-01-10 07:30] <Kangarooo> So where is my swap file so i overwrite it not make new named as in tutorials swapfile
[2024-01-10 07:37] <CosmicDJ> Kangarooo: you don't have swapfile, you have a logical volume used for swap
[2024-01-10 08:14] <V1A> foods
[2024-01-10 08:32] <Kangarooo> CosmicDJ: so i cant increase swap? i can add now more swap by making swapfile?
[2024-01-10 11:41] <guiverc> Kangarooo, you can use swapfile + swap partition; there maybe a slight overhead cost with 2x swap; but I've used both myself (adding swapfile when I needed extra swap beyond what my swap partition had allocated)
[2024-01-10 12:05] <m45faleh> Hi
[2024-01-10 12:06] <m45faleh> Hello
[2024-01-10 12:20] <lilo_booter> running 22.04 here and just got a new kernel update - going from 6.2.0-39 to 6.5.0-14 - system does not boot with the 6.5.0 kernel - anyone know what's going on?
[2024-01-10 12:34] <d3vil> Something went wrong
[2024-01-10 12:41] <lilo_booter> d3vil: yup - seems that way...
[2024-01-10 12:41] <dgutov> Hopefully you still have a grub entry with the previous kernel
[2024-01-10 12:42] <d3vil> lilo_booter: it's just booting old, or new one hands the process? did you check boot log?
[2024-01-10 12:42] <lilo_booter> yeah - no problems starting up with the old one
[2024-01-10 12:42] <lilo_booter> it's the new one which is broken
[2024-01-10 12:44] <ravage> Without any errors messages it is impossible to help you really
[2024-01-10 12:44] <d3vil> just enable log output and paste it here
[2024-01-10 12:46] <lilo_booter> hmm - i get that - but when i try to boot from the 6.5.0 kernel either as default or in maintenance mode, it just reboots the entire box and goes back to grub - the only way to get a log is when i'm running on the old kernel, and as i said, that one is fine
[2024-01-10 12:49] <lotuspsychje> lilo_booter: journalctl -b -1 to track a previous boot
[2024-01-10 12:49] <lilo_booter> ah - thanks :)
[2024-01-10 12:49] <lotuspsychje> or journalctl --list-boots
[2024-01-10 12:50] <d3vil> lotuspsychje: if it reboots before systemd it will be empty
[2024-01-10 12:50] <lilo_booter> yup - empty - all i see is 6.2.39 boots going back to december some time
[2024-01-10 12:50] <lilo_booter> sorry 6.2.0-39
[2024-01-10 12:51] <d3vil> try to add kernel params like panic=0 loglevel=5 and remove such params as quiet etc.
[2024-01-10 12:51] <lotuspsychje> ok, then the forward way, press F1 at boot for text mode and see where it gets stuck
[2024-01-10 12:51] <lilo_booter> ok - i will have to pick this up after work though - actually kinda in a meeting right now :)
[2024-01-10 12:52] <lilo_booter> also tried that, think i saw an error but it flashed up quick and went before i could read it
[2024-01-10 12:52] <lilo_booter> thanks for the help guys - will try some reboots in 4 hours or so...
[2024-01-10 12:57] <ogra_> lilo_booter, also, #ubuntu-kernel might be able to help ...
[2024-01-10 13:08] <lotuspsychje> lilo_booter: maybe bug #2047590 related?
[2024-01-10 13:21] <ioria> current for mantic is 6.5.0.14.16, the bug is for  6.5.0-14.14 , maybe you need to full-upgrade lilo_booter
[2024-01-10 13:23] <lotuspsychje> ioria: he said he's on 22.04?
[2024-01-10 13:23] <ioria> oh, ok
[2024-01-10 13:24] <lotuspsychje> HWE then
[2024-01-10 13:24] <ioria> then he's using jammy-proposed
[2024-01-10 13:25] <lotuspsychje> linux-image-generic-hwe-22.04 (6.5.0.14.14~22.04.7, jammy
[2024-01-10 13:26] <ioria> i see
[2024-01-10 13:51] <lilo_booter> excellent - thanks for the continued info - but nope, i am not using jammy-poposed
[2024-01-10 13:52] <lilo_booter> https://dpaste.com/BZM74FLZ9
[2024-01-10 13:53] <lilo_booter> also checked in sources.d dir and no proposed showing up there either
[2024-01-10 13:55] <ioria> lilo_booter, and can you boot the previous kernel ?
[2024-01-10 14:08] <lilo_booter> ioria: yup - previous kernel is fine
[2024-01-10 14:13] <lilo_booter> lotuspsychje: yup - that seems related, but as above, i am running 22.04 (22.04.3 according to /etc/issue), not 23.10 - so it's unclear to me why i would have got this specific kernel upgrade
[2024-01-10 14:26] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-10 14:27] <ravage> kernel 6.5 is in the  linux-image-generic-hwe-22.04-edge package
[2024-01-10 14:27] <ravage> i just got inux-image-generic-hwe-22.04-edge_6.5.0.14.14~22.04.7_amd64.deb
[2024-01-10 14:28] <ravage> will tell you in a moment how my reboot goes
[2024-01-10 14:32] <ravage> back on "6.5.0-14-generic #14~22.04.1-Ubuntu". booted fine
[2024-01-10 14:37] <lilo_booter> ravage: good to hear
[2024-01-10 14:42] <pavlos> my question: https://termbin.com/q08e
[2024-01-10 14:43] <toddc> 1234
[2024-01-10 14:43] <pavlos> toddc: shhhhh
[2024-01-10 14:46] <lilo_booter> pavlos - don't use tabs to align things like that - try with printf like: printf "%8s %4d\n" hello 1
[2024-01-10 14:48] <leftyfb> pavlos: lilo_booter is correct. This would also be a perfect question for #bash
[2024-01-10 14:48] <pavlos> leftyfb: sorry
[2024-01-10 14:48] <pavlos> lilo_booter: ty
[2024-01-10 14:49] <lilo_booter> np :)
[2024-01-10 14:49] <leftyfb> pavlos: no need to apologize. It's fine to ask here, but it's verymuch focused on bash and the folks in #bash are VERY good, though usually with a bit of an attitude
[2024-01-10 14:54] <pragmaticenigma> pavlos: think of the line being broken up into blocks of 5 characters. Each tab will fill the remainder of a block. If the preceeding text ends on a complete block, you will get two full blocks for the tabs you defined. If the text does not, the tab will fill in the remainder of the current block. then add one more block.
[2024-01-10 15:06] <lbracher> Hello! I'm using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and recently I'm experiencing a disconnection of almost all my USB devices. I could make them work again by restarting the computer, but even using this I'm not able to use them again. Here's a paste of dmesg with a grep for a USB device, could anyone help me with this? Thanks a lot! https://dpaste.org/UbqSe
[2024-01-10 15:08] <leftyfb> lbracher: try adding usbcore.autosuspend=-1 to your kernel parameters
[2024-01-10 15:11] <pragmaticenigma> lbracher: Start with unplugging all devices, then add one at a time. The behavior sounds like one of your USB devices might be trying to draw too much power from the computer.
[2024-01-10 15:12] <leftyfb> they left
[2024-01-10 15:14] <pragmaticenigma> ships passing in the night
[2024-01-10 15:17] <lbracher> leftyfb, it worked for some seconds, until it got disconnected 42 seconds after reboot.

[2024-01-10 15:18] <lbracher> pragmaticenigma, I'll try that. Thanks!
[2024-01-10 15:18] <pragmaticenigma> lbracher: or use a powered USB hub to connect your devices, such as a docking station with an external power supply.
[2024-01-10 15:21] <pragmaticenigma> lbracher: or use a powered USB hub to connect your devices, such as a docking station with an external power supply.
[2024-01-10 15:22] <lbracher> pragmaticenigma, looks like this is the answer! I'm using a cheap USB ethernet dongle, I decided to not connect it and just connect the mouse and the bluetooth, and it worked! Thanks!
[2024-01-10 15:22] <lbracher> It's probably draining so much current
[2024-01-10 15:22] <lbracher> I need to buy one that uses external DC current
[2024-01-10 15:22] <lbracher> Thanks!

[2024-01-10 16:22] <pragmaticenigma> derek-shnosh: Unlikely, though when creating a file name, if you end it with .md it shouldn't change the file extention or add .txt
[2024-01-10 16:23] <derek-shnosh> pragmaticenigma: yeah, was hoping to find a way to default it to .md so I don't have to clear .txt. 99.99% of the time I save/work in .md.
[2024-01-10 16:28] <pragmaticenigma> derek-shnosh: I'd choose a different editor that allows you that choice, or doesn't default. You could look into something like VSCodium
[2024-01-10 16:29] <derek-shnosh> pragmaticenigma: thanks, I do use VScod* daily, but like to have a more basic editor open for my daily notes/etc.
[2024-01-10 17:20] <FKAShinobi_> Does ubuntu have any feature that allows backup to cloud providers?
[2024-01-10 17:26] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi_: a quick google search turned up duplicity and restic as both supporting multiple cloud providers
[2024-01-10 17:27] <pragmaticenigma> FKAShinobi_: In settings you can also attach your machine to a cloud provider, and just make it a point to save your documents and files in the folders that are sync'd with that service.
[2024-01-10 17:28] <neo> j
[2024-01-10 17:31] <FKAShinobi_> leftyfb pragmaticenigma: Thank you. Restic is alpha and am unsure if it will be sufficient for a 7TB backup. I'll look at duplicity and attaching the machine to the provider directly. I assume attaching a cloud provider will look like any other mounted fs, correct?
[2024-01-10 17:31] <rfm> FKAShinobi_, I just do a "aws s3 sync" to a bucket I've set up to keep a couple versions ...
[2024-01-10 17:34] <pragmaticenigma> FKAShinobi_: 7TB? my suggestion may not be the best choice for that much data. I was thinking you were interested in backing up personal documents, photos, and the like. Sounds like you're trying to do a full system backup
[2024-01-10 17:35] <pragmaticenigma> (my assumption was thinking you were using something like Google Drive, Microsoft One Drive, Dropbox, or something similar)
[2024-01-10 17:35] <FKAShinobi_> pragmaticenigma: Back up a NAS to rebuild it.
[2024-01-10 17:40] <johnfg> hi folks
[2024-01-10 17:41] <johnfg> Hopefully someone dealt with the vile stuff someone was spewing here on Monday.
[2024-01-10 17:41] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi_: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-easystore-8tb-external-usb-3-0-hard-drive-black/6425302.p?skuId=6425302
[2024-01-10 17:41] <johnfg> Anyway, for some reason, by 22.04 system sometimes doesn't connect to wifi.
[2024-01-10 17:42] <johnfg> When it comes up, it doesn't even show it, and there's no way to start it in settings.  Is this a known problem?
[2024-01-10 17:50] <pragmaticenigma> FKAShinobi_: Agreed, do not back up your drive to the cloud for a system rebuilt. I would recommend purchasing a local storage device and save things there. Way too much could go wrong with expecting the cloud provider to be a good custodian of your data while your trying to rebyuild things.
[2024-01-10 17:52] <pragmaticenigma> FKAShinobi_: It will save you a lot of money, and then you have a local backup (which you should have anyways) to restore data if something were to go wrong with your server
[2024-01-10 17:55] <FKAShinobi_> leftyfb pragmaticenigma: Thank you. I was considering mega.io because it costs ~$21.88 for 8TB storage and 8TB egress. The drive would be helpful for this backup. The NAS is being expanded to 14 TB so would need yet another drive to backup the NAS.
[2024-01-10 18:00] <pavlos> toddc: sent email
[2024-01-10 18:01] <Guest4090> Hello from IRC server on WSL
[2024-01-10 18:01] <pragmaticenigma> FKAShinobi_: The cost looks nice at the beginning, until something doesn't go right and then you're stuck paying a bigger bill for the longer storage time or they have a price increase mid-operation.
[2024-01-10 18:01] <FKAShinobi_> pragmaticenigma: Gotcha
[2024-01-10 18:09] <arraybolt3> Also mega's file encryption is flawed and insecure, don't rely on them for safety (or any other cloud storage built-in encryption fornthat matter).
[2024-01-10 18:09] <arraybolt3> *for that
[2024-01-10 18:09] <pragmaticenigma> arraybolt3: you need to qualify that with a reputable resource please
[2024-01-10 18:09] <arraybolt3> https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/06/mega-claims-it-cant-decrypt-your-files-but-someones-managed-to

[2024-01-10 18:10] <arraybolt3> leftyfb: valid
[2024-01-10 18:11] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi_: a local storage copy will be quicker by a matter of days
[2024-01-10 18:18] <Menzador> Actually I'm going to corollary this: Have MULTIPLE backups. Back it up to multiple places just in case, especially if the data possesses a level of significant importance
[2024-01-10 20:07] <sanane> ÅÄ±
[2024-01-10 20:16] <CosmicDJ> is there a page or blog about what's new in kernel 6.5 for 22.04 LTS?
[2024-01-10 20:27] <pragmaticenigma> CosmicDJ: http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux/
[2024-01-10 21:07] <Kangarooo> if in /var/crash/ i have files

[2024-01-10 21:07] <Kangarooo> then they didnt send? because launchpad didnt open. or for some crashes launchpad dont open?
[2024-01-10 21:07] <leftyfb> there's no point in sending multiple of the same issue. Just delete them
[2024-01-10 21:24] <tomreyn> Kangarooo: crash logs don't go to launchpad, they go to errors.ubuntu.com (via 'daisy'). To see the crashes your system reported so far: xdg-open https://errors.ubuntu.com/user/$(sudo cat /var/lib/whoopsie/whoopsie-id)
[2024-01-10 21:26] <magic_ninja> So I had another mouse plugged in earlier. Despite rebooting, the options where still on that mouse.
[2024-01-10 21:28] <tomreyn> magic_ninja: i think this is lacking context. you don't seem to have discussed this topic here previously.
[2024-01-10 21:30] <pragmaticenigma> magic_ninja: you started your support thread in #kde
[2024-01-10 21:30] <magic_ninja> tomreyn, sorry about that, got confused
[2024-01-10 21:31] <tomreyn> no worries, i just thought i'd point it out since it looked like a loose thread.
[2024-01-10 21:54] <ph88> is it possible to update the mesa driver? how can i do this ?
[2024-01-10 22:02] <pragmaticenigma> ph88: Any such thing would result in an unsupported system here. Updates are provided through Ubuntu's package management applications (apt, Ubuntu Software) which used supported package repositories.
[2024-01-10 22:03] <ph88> ok i guess i wait for the next release then ^^
[2024-01-10 22:06] <pragmaticenigma> ph88: Is there an issue with your computer that has resulted in you thinking you needed an upgraded version?
[2024-01-10 22:08] <ph88> yes the graphics freeze and then i have to hit the reset button
[2024-01-10 23:00] <JanC> ph88: you should file a bug report for such things; maybe it can be fixed...
[2024-01-10 23:02] <pragmaticenigma> don't see how that's helpful JanC , untill someone has taken the time to try and triage to determine if in fact it's a bug, hardware failure, or system resource deficiency
[2024-01-10 23:05] <ph88> maybe if it was a bug it is already solved in the new mesa version
[2024-01-10 23:06] <pragmaticenigma> ph88: it's quite a leap to go from my graphics freeze, to assuming it's a new driver version required. drivers are just conduits that allow the software to talk to the hardware. there are many layers between what the application shows on the screen down to that driver level that could be the culprit.
[2024-01-10 23:10] <ph88> it's not about what an application is showing, the whole screen freezes
[2024-01-10 23:11] <pragmaticenigma> ph88: log files are were to start, then escalating to installing trace tools that attempt to capture and log system and kernel faults. There'a also the lack of you describing what you were doing when the graphics froze. Were you playing a game in steam, were you browsing the web, what was running on the computer before you left and came back to find it locked up
[2024-01-10 23:13] <ph88> it's likely firefox crashing because of new hardware acceleration capabilities. But a userland program should not be able to crash the graphics like that. I assume driver problem
[2024-01-10 23:17] <pragmaticenigma> ph88: did you try disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox? are you running X11 mode or Wayland. You're leaving out a lot of details. If there was a driver problem, you'd be experiencing this issue in multiple places. not just under one program.
[2024-01-10 23:17] <ph88> no i didn't try to disable hardware acceleration, that's an idea i could try
[2024-01-10 23:17] <ph88> i don't have many details
[2024-01-11 00:36] <sem> Just now I booted up and my ethernet connection was down. I rebooted and it worked, and it got me thinking; is there a way to power cycle the ethernet adapter without rebooting?
[2024-01-11 00:37] <rbox> sem: you can't power cycle a pci card
[2024-01-11 00:38] <sem> could I do something like ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up; but with the modern tools?
[2024-01-11 00:38] <rbox> well that's not goign to reset anything, but sure, you can try that
[2024-01-11 00:39] <sem> i tried ip enp4s0 up but it didn't work
[2024-01-11 00:39] <rbox> yeah, randomly guessing at what a commands syntax is tends not to go well
[2024-01-11 00:39] <sem> yeah :( and I didn't have internet
[2024-01-11 00:39] <sem> so I couldn't really search
[2024-01-11 00:39] <sem> i read the man of ip but gave up
[2024-01-11 00:40] <sem> i can search now but I still can't really figure it out
[2024-01-11 00:40] <ERROR_418> sem: I'd make sure that the cable isn't loose in the port, make sure the retention clip is actually holding on both ends
[2024-01-11 00:40] <sem> ERROR_418, yeah that was the first thing I checked; tight at both ends, all the lights working, etc., and it worked after rebooting
[2024-01-11 00:41] <shadow255> sem: I just peeked at that manpage and an example stands out pretty quickly for ip link x set up (where x is the device name)
[2024-01-11 00:41] <sem> looking..
[2024-01-11 00:41] <shadow255> sem: at the end of the page with examples
[2024-01-11 00:41] <sem> ah ok; i didn't make it past the synopsis
[2024-01-11 00:42] <sem> thanks for the help!
[2024-01-11 00:42] <shadow255> and I meant to say x is the interface name

[2024-01-11 02:27] <dgutov> Hi all! If someone is curious about my complains about the crashing GNOME session from a few days ago, here's where I have tracked the problem so far: https://gitlab.com/dikasetyaprayogi/light-shell/-/issues/4
[2024-01-11 02:48] <aarush> are there any fun things to do with armbian?
[2024-01-11 02:49] <rbox> huh?
[2024-01-11 03:17] <Zed`> I hope this is not too newbie a question but any shell script can be made to run at startup/reboot by adding a service unit file that points to it to /etc/systemd/system/somescript.service and enabling it? Or is there a better way to do it? My old brain could not find an /etc/rc.local :)
[2024-01-11 03:18] <rbox> yes, create service file
[2024-01-11 03:23] <Zed`> cool thanks

[2024-01-11 09:23] <lesshaste> how can I stop software updater from popping up to tell me about ubuntu pro updates?
[2024-01-11 09:30] <lubuntu_> Die Corax Transe nervt schon ziemlich hart
[2024-01-11 10:22] <mjg> hello. i'm trying to find out why the ubuntu kernel ships with CONFIG_UBSAN=y. so far i have no luck finding a git repo or an equivalent which would give me the commit which added it
[2024-01-11 10:22] <mjg> any clues?
[2024-01-11 10:26] <ikonia> mjg: what does that setting do ?
[2024-01-11 10:26] <ikonia> (and is important to you?)
[2024-01-11 10:26] <mjg> https://docs.kernel.org/dev-tools/ubsan.html
[2024-01-11 10:27] <mjg> it is a major single-threaded slowdown, so i'm curious how it landed in production kernels
[2024-01-11 10:27] <mjg> for all i know it's an accident
[2024-01-11 10:27] <ikonia> I'm just reading, I'm not aware of the setting, one moment
[2024-01-11 10:28] <ikonia> Hmmm. I wonder (I have no knowedge of this) if it's there by default to enable ubuntu as a developer platform
[2024-01-11 10:28] <ikonia> rather than for actual debugging
[2024-01-11 10:28] <mjg> that would be only of consequence for kernel developers
[2024-01-11 10:28] <ikonia> I don't know how bad it impacts a single thread performance, but I can see it would have an impact
[2024-01-11 10:29] <mjg> which would build their own kernels anyuway
[2024-01-11 10:29] <ikonia> mjg: yes, which would make more sense to ship as a -developer kernel package
[2024-01-11 10:29] <mjg> so how can i find out how this ended up being enabled
[2024-01-11 10:30] <ikonia> I'd look at the launchpad details of the package but you may need to contact/log a bug type request
[2024-01-11 10:30] <mjg> i tried that, got noghing
[2024-01-11 10:31] <mjg> for example in debian there is a publicly available repo https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/linux/-/blob/master/debian/config/config
[2024-01-11 10:31] <mjg> i would hope ubuntu has an equivalent
[2024-01-11 10:37] <mkukri> mjg: the ubuntu kernel sources live here: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/+git
[2024-01-11 10:38] <mjg> mkukri: i had seen that repo, i did not find configs in there
[2024-01-11 10:40] <mjg> now that i'm poking again i take that back
[2024-01-11 10:41] <mkukri> https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/noble/tree/debian.master/config/annotations
[2024-01-11 10:41] <mjg> for example https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/focal/commit/debian.master/config/amd64/config.common.amd64?id=44120274bdc294fd1808aa2a1e8386d8e09ee307
[2024-01-11 10:41] <mjg> ye, thanks man
[2024-01-11 10:41] <mkukri> focal is 20.04, you'll likely want to look at something more recent
[2024-01-11 10:55] <oem> passord
[2024-01-11 11:12] <ikonia> mjg: apologies, I had to take a phone call, do you know if that feature is enabled in the debian kernel ?
[2024-01-11 11:13] <ikonia> mjg: also some of the people in #ubuntu-kernel atively work on the kernel package and maybe able to do a little bit of research behind the curtain
[2024-01-11 11:17] <mjg> found the origin https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1914685
[2024-01-11 11:17] <mjg> with CONFIG_UBSAN_ONLY_BOUNDS=y (which *is* enabled) it is not tragic
[2024-01-11 11:51] <ikonia> lets have a read

[2024-01-11 15:07] <Guest77> Hello, I have recently upgraded to 22.04 (from ubuntu 16 LTS, via 18 and 20). When I run "Pulseaudio volume control" it says "establishing connection to pulseaudio. please wait" and nothing happens. And youtube videos in firefox don't produce any sound. How can I figure out what's wrong?
[2024-01-11 15:09] <pavlos> inxi -A should show 3 sound servers running
[2024-01-11 15:11] <Guest77> $ inxi -A
[2024-01-11 15:11] <Guest77> Audio:
[2024-01-11 15:11] <Guest77> Â  Device-1: Intel 6 Series/C200 Series Family High Definition Audio

[2024-01-11 15:11] <Maik> Guest77: please use pastebin for large outputs
[2024-01-11 15:11] <Maik> don't post them here
[2024-01-11 15:12] <Guest77> sorry. see three sound servers: alsa, pulseaudio and pipewire, all running
[2024-01-11 15:13] <BluesKaj> Guest77, oprn alsamixer in the terminal and make sure automiye is disabled, use up/down arrow keys to disable
[2024-01-11 15:13] <BluesKaj> automute rather
[2024-01-11 15:13] <Guest77> however, pulseaudio --check; echo $? returns 1
[2024-01-11 15:16] <Guest77> I ran alsamixer and turned off all the MM's. Still no audio output from firefox/youtube
[2024-01-11 15:16] <oerheks> remove the ~/.config/pulse/  folder and restart sound?
[2024-01-11 15:16] <oerheks> and restart browser
[2024-01-11 15:16] <Guest77> it should work in chromium I guess? I am running this irc session in firefox :-)
[2024-01-11 15:17] <Guest77> dumb question, how do I restart sound?
[2024-01-11 15:17] <oerheks> pulseaudio --kill # and it should respawn again
[2024-01-11 15:18] <Guest77> it gives an error: failed to kill daemon, no such file or directory
[2024-01-11 15:21] <Guest77> I moved ~/.pulse* and ~/.config/pulse* to /var/tmp for safe keeping, ran pulseaudio --kill (gives the error) and then pulseaudio --start
[2024-01-11 15:21] <Guest77> there's no output, and the mixer still doesn't work
[2024-01-11 15:22] <Guest77> also in my syslog it says starting sound service... started sound service every 20 seconds
[2024-01-11 15:22] <Guest77> so I think something is still broken :-(
[2024-01-11 15:22] <Guest77> is "sound service" the same as pulseaudio?
[2024-01-11 15:23] <pavlos> ps -ef | grep pulseaudio ... one line with pid
[2024-01-11 15:23] <Guest77> I have 5 matching processes, excluding grep
[2024-01-11 15:23] <Guest77> 3 processes are "pulseaudio --start"
[2024-01-11 15:24] <pavlos> user         826     816  0 Jan10 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/pulseaudio --daemonize=no --log-target=journal
[2024-01-11 15:24] <Guest77> one is "/u/b/pulseaudio --daemonize-no --log-target=journal"
[2024-01-11 15:24] <Guest77> yes!
[2024-01-11 15:25] <Guest77> and one is "/u/b/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/panel/wrapper-2.0 /blah/blah/plugins/libpulseaudio-plugin.so"
[2024-01-11 15:26] <Guest77> but the --daemonize=no process seems to be the one that is dying and being restarted: the process start time is always the current time, and the pid keeps changing
[2024-01-11 15:33] <Guest77> how do I see the pulseaudio log in the systemd journal?
[2024-01-11 15:37] <ravage> journalctl --user -u pulseaudio
[2024-01-11 15:39] <Guest77> thanks. I didn't see anything useful-looking there unfortunately
[2024-01-11 15:40] <Guest77> is pipewire relevant to this?
[2024-01-11 15:40] <ioria2> Guest77, systemctl --user status pipewire-session-manager.service
[2024-01-11 15:41] <Guest77> it's been running for 42 minutes. There are some log messages: mod.rt: RTKit error: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied
[2024-01-11 15:41] <Guest77> but I don't know if that is going to kill my audio?
[2024-01-11 15:42] <ioria2> what ?
[2024-01-11 15:42] <Guest77> My issue is that I have no audio output. I am trying to figure out why. But audio output has always been a big mystery to me... all I know right now is that the pulseaudio process is restarting every 20 seconds, but I don't know why.
[2024-01-11 15:43] <ioria2> Guest77, did you run this ?   'systemctl --user status pipewire-session-manager.service'
[2024-01-11 15:43] <Guest77> Yes I did. I can paste the output somewhere...
[2024-01-11 15:44] <ioria2> Guest77, systemctl --user status pipewire-session-manager.service | nc termbin.com 9999

[2024-01-11 15:47] <ioria2> Guest77, systemctl status --user pipewire.service | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-11 15:49] <Guest77> I can't seem to use termbin, maybe port 9999 is firewalled by my network. Here's the pastebin for pipewire.service: https://pastebin.com/raw/mWNQAkz9
[2024-01-11 15:51] <Guest77> Those mod.rt lines are yellow, fwiw!
[2024-01-11 15:51] <ioria2> something messed up (or missing) in the upgrade ...
[2024-01-11 15:53] <Guest77> yes! does it look to you like the problem is with pipewire? or pulseaudio?
[2024-01-11 15:53] <Guest77> Can I use pulseaudio without pipewire?
[2024-01-11 15:53] <ioria2> Guest77, systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse
[2024-01-11 15:54] <ioria2> Guest77, and check pavucontrol (or sound settings) again
[2024-01-11 15:54] <benni_b> hi. I have a ubuntu laptop with tightvncserver installed. I'm running Xorg desktop on it. I'm a bit unsure how to configure the xstartup file in accordance to Xorg? Or can I have it configured for xfce as per the guides I'm reading even though I'm logged in to it with Xorg?
[2024-01-11 15:54] <Guest77> Failed to restart pipewire-pulse.service: Unit pipewire-pulse.service not found.
[2024-01-11 15:54] <pragmaticenigma> Guest77: You can, as pulseaudio precedes pipewire. However, pulseaudio is already on track to be removed in a future release. You're better off trying to get pipewire working
[2024-01-11 15:55] <BluesKaj> Guest77, install pipewire-pulse.
[2024-01-11 15:56] <pragmaticenigma> benni_b: If you're trying to share your active desktop session in Ubuntu, you will have to use the built in tools from the Settings manager. The way the desktop is setup it will not let you initiate a shared screen without an authenticated session already started.
[2024-01-11 15:56] <ioria2> yep, that .. and also sudo apt --reinstall install pipewire-media-session
[2024-01-11 15:56] <ioria2> Guest77, ^
[2024-01-11 15:57] <Guest77> thanks! pavucontrol still says "please wait..." and does nothing
[2024-01-11 15:58] <ioria2> Guest77, again  'systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse'
[2024-01-11 15:58] <Guest77> same behaviour after that.
[2024-01-11 15:59] <ioria2> but it started ?
[2024-01-11 15:59] <Guest77> well, no error messages anyway!
[2024-01-11 15:59] <ioria2> Guest77, systemctl --user restart pipewire-session-manager
[2024-01-11 16:00] <Guest77> oh wait, systemctl status --user pipewire-pulse has some errors

[2024-01-11 16:00] <benni_b> pragmaticenigma, ok understood. But I don't really need to connect to an active session I guess. But the way you describe, I would use the "Remote Desktop Address" field from the "Remote Desktop" settings page?
[2024-01-11 16:01] <ioria2> Guest77, i see;   systemctl --user restart pipewire-session-manager
[2024-01-11 16:01] <Guest77> done. (pavucontrol not working yet...)
[2024-01-11 16:01] <ioria2> no errors?

[2024-01-11 16:08] <woo_> hmmm...
[2024-01-11 16:08] <woo_> ?
[2024-01-11 16:09] <HD140283> So the gpt error is on the sdd drive holding the OS /dev/sdd - to fix the gpt error do I need to boot with a live version of Ubuntu or whatever and ..? I've read stuff online but I'm still confused.

[2024-01-11 16:19] <ioria2> Guest77, ok
[2024-01-11 16:20] <woo_> na that not a question but i let you know when i do
[2024-01-11 16:20] <woo_> have a question
[2024-01-11 16:45] <Guest77> hello, I am on 22.04. When I run echo -e 'GET / HTTP/1.1\n\n' | nc localhost 80 I get a response from micro_httpd. How do I disable micro_httpd? It seems init is listening to port 80 but I don't know the systemctl magic to disable micro_httpd
[2024-01-11 16:45] <Guest77> I don't want anything to respond on port 80, unless I start a daemon.
[2024-01-11 16:47] <ioria2> Guest77, is micro-httpd installed ? dpkg -l | grep micro-httpd
[2024-01-11 16:50] <Guest77> yes it is: ii micro-httpd 20140814-2.1 amd64 really small HTTP server
[2024-01-11 16:50] <Guest77> it's fine to be installed, I just don't want it running automatically
[2024-01-11 16:52] <ioria2> Guest77, It runs from inetd  not sure if there's a service for it; let's try :  'systemctl --all | grep -i http'
[2024-01-11 16:52] <pragmaticenigma> Guest77: I don't know what service it will name itself, but it should be something like running `sudo systemctl stop micro_httpd.service` sudo systemctrl disable micro_httpd.service`
[2024-01-11 16:54] <genii> pragmaticenigma: It runs from inetd
[2024-01-11 16:54] <Guest77> thanks! it's micro_httpd.socket. I had found it before and ran the disable line, but didn't think to stop it first
[2024-01-11 16:54] <Guest77> it's gone now :)
[2024-01-11 16:54] <leftyfb> Guest77: why install that if you don't want it running?
[2024-01-11 16:55] <ioria2> Guest77, not just stopping... it will restart next reboot. you need to disable it
[2024-01-11 16:56] <Guest77> yes, I stopped and disabled it. Before your advice I had only disabled it and wondered why it hadn't disappeared.
[2024-01-11 16:56] <ioria2> Guest77, ok
[2024-01-11 16:56] <Guest77> leftyfb: seems useful to have around for ad hoc stuff, I don't know really!
[2024-01-11 16:56] <leftyfb> Guest77: https://realpython.com/python-http-server/
[2024-01-11 16:57] <leftyfb> Guest77: just running this will spin up a temporary http server: python3 -m http.server
[2024-01-11 16:57] <Guest77> well, yes, that's an option...
[2024-01-11 17:03] <Guest77> ok, another new-to-22.04 issue. The firefox print dialog only offers print to PDF, and no real printers. Is that because it's a snap now? Can it be fixed?
[2024-01-11 17:04] <Guest77> I see the real printers fine in evince
[2024-01-11 17:05] <leftyfb> Guest77: sudo snap connect firefox:cups-control
[2024-01-11 17:05] <Guest77> leftyfb: magic, thank you!
[2024-01-11 17:07] <Guest8> Trying to get the look of the Ubuntu default Desktop via VNC, but this looks like crap, can VNC not setup a good looking gnome session?
[2024-01-11 17:08] <leftyfb> Guest8: it sounds like you're not connected to the running gnome session
[2024-01-11 17:09] <Guest8> yes exactly, how can I do that?
[2024-01-11 17:09] <leftyfb> Guest8: https://tecadmin.net/setup-x11vnc-server-on-ubuntu-linuxmint/
[2024-01-11 17:10] <Guest8> is tightvnc server causing my grief, x11vnc server better or they the same?
[2024-01-11 17:10] <tomreyn> note that this will work with X11 only, not wayland.
[2024-01-11 17:10] <leftyfb> tomreyn: pretty sure all VNC servers only work with xorg, not wayland
[2024-01-11 17:10] <tomreyn> leftyfb: i would think so, too
[2024-01-11 17:12] <pragmaticenigma> there is wayvnc in development :)
[2024-01-11 17:13] <tomreyn> and gnome's freerdp integration in production
[2024-01-11 17:14] <leftyfb> freerdp is based on the RDP protocol, not VNC
[2024-01-11 17:15] <leftyfb> ubuntu already comes with the ability to enable an RDP servers
[2024-01-11 17:16] <tomreyn> Guest8: they differ, see     apt show tightvncserver x11vnc
[2024-01-11 17:16] <Guest8> x11vnc fails with "XOpenDisplay(":0") failed.
[2024-01-11 17:17] <Guest8> x11vnc was unable to open the X DISPLAY, I am root right now, and not sure there seems to be talk about already having an x session before this can work, what does that mean exactly? I just installed ubuntu-desktop
[2024-01-11 17:18] <leftyfb> export DISPLAY=:0 x11vnc .....
[2024-01-11 17:18] <leftyfb> also, don't be root
[2024-01-11 17:21] <Guest8> got same error as newly created user
[2024-01-11 17:21] <leftyfb> Guest8: you need to start gdm
[2024-01-11 17:21] <leftyfb> sudo systemctl start gdm
[2024-01-11 17:21] <leftyfb> Guest8: I take it this is a server. Why do you need VNC?
[2024-01-11 17:22] <Guest8> its a VM, and user wants to use desktop
[2024-01-11 17:22] <Guest8> so no choice but to remote in
[2024-01-11 17:22] <pragmaticenigma> Guest8: The instructions that you are following for a shared active session.
[2024-01-11 17:23] <pragmaticenigma> where there's an active local session already running
[2024-01-11 17:23] <petn-randall> Hi, can someone tell me what makes the 'linux-image-nvidia' different over 'linux-image-generic'? The description is quite vague.
[2024-01-11 17:24] <Guest8> ah so this is why gdm start is asking me to authenticate as some other user
[2024-01-11 17:25] <leftyfb> Guest8: in order to run commands with sudo, it will ask you to authenticate as your user, not another
[2024-01-11 17:25] <Guest8> no I mean "systemctl start gdm" asked me to authenticate as some other user, I take it this means they already had/have a session
[2024-01-11 17:25] <leftyfb> Guest8: sudo systemctl start gdm
[2024-01-11 17:26] <Guest8> Gnome display manager is showing as active
[2024-01-11 17:26] <Guest8> ah ok so gdm says started now
[2024-01-11 17:26] <Guest8> will try x11vnc command again
[2024-01-11 17:28] <Guest8> same problem x11vnc was unable to open the X DISPLAY: ":0"
[2024-01-11 17:29] <leftyfb> export DISPLAY=:1 x11vnc .....
[2024-01-11 17:30] <Guest8> same error
[2024-01-11 17:31] <Guest8> why use this x11vnc method over VNC, will VNC not connect to the gdm correctly?
[2024-01-11 17:31] <tomreyn> petn-randall: try asking this in #ubuntu-kernel with much patience
[2024-01-11 17:32] <tomreyn> (or inspect the code on launchpad)
[2024-01-11 17:32] <leftyfb> Guest8: other VNC servers try to start their own session
[2024-01-11 17:32] <Guest8> I see
[2024-01-11 17:33] <Guest8> so when you can get x11vnc working, how does one remote over, same client RealVNC viewer?
[2024-01-11 17:33] <leftyfb> any VNC client should do
[2024-01-11 17:34] <Guest8> so something is conflicting with the display
[2024-01-11 17:35] <leftyfb> no, something isn't configured correctly
[2024-01-11 17:35] <leftyfb> sorry, having my own troubleshooting I'm working on at the moment and can't focus on this as I would like
[2024-01-11 17:35] <Guest8> I followed the steps, installed x11vnc then set password
[2024-01-11 17:36] <Guest8> of course no worries, appreciate the advice
[2024-01-11 17:42] <petn-randall> tomreyn: Will do, thanks.
[2024-01-11 17:48] <pragmaticenigma> GDM and x11vnc are incompatible, they have been for awhile. Without knowing what instructions you're following it's hard to know what you are setting up. There are two approaches to setting up a VNC service. One is where you intended to share the desktop of a locally authenticated user running an already authenticated session. The other is were you both authenticate and start a user session with a VNC client.
[2024-01-11 17:48] <Guest8> I was given
[2024-01-11 17:48] <Guest8> https://tecadmin.net/setup-x11vnc-server-on-ubuntu-linuxmint/
[2024-01-11 17:48] <Guest8> from someone here earlier
[2024-01-11 17:49] <pragmaticenigma> which you didn't actually read cause you missed the part "and -display :0 tells the server to share your current X11 session."
[2024-01-11 17:50] <Guest8> I just want to be able to remotely connect to a GUI, finding the tightvnc setup just an ugly impementation and was hoping for something closer to the Ubuntu Desktop
[2024-01-11 17:51] <pragmaticenigma> hopefully your server isn't running an active GUI session full time. as that would leave the system open to malicious use when no one is around to monitor the machine.
[2024-01-11 17:51] <Guest8> it shouldnt be
[2024-01-11 17:52] <Guest8> if this server is a remote VM, what entails a X11 session already in play?
[2024-01-11 17:52] <pragmaticenigma> and that's why the command you're providing keeps failing. because the command "x11vnc -usepw -display :0" expects a user to be authenticated and logged into an active GUI session on the machine
[2024-01-11 17:52] <Guest8> I see
[2024-01-11 17:55] <Guest8> I just want to give access remotely to a GUI in Ubuntu
[2024-01-11 17:55] <Guest8> sounds like I am better off going back to tightvnc, since it creates it on the fly and destroys when done
[2024-01-11 17:55] <Guest8> but it looked like crap lol
[2024-01-11 17:55] <pragmaticenigma> Yes that's exactly what you should be using. And the "looks like crap" is just some configuration options to improve.
[2024-01-11 17:55] <pragmaticenigma> Read the documentation
[2024-01-11 17:55] <leftyfb> Guest8: I have to imagine there's better solutions to your overall goal
[2024-01-11 17:56] <leftyfb> Guest8: what exactly is the use case? What will these people be doing? How many connected at once?
[2024-01-11 17:56] <Guest8> I am not finding any documentation on tightvnc setup with gnome that doesnt look like a kindergarten student didnt color in
[2024-01-11 17:57] <Guest8> just a user that doesnt want to sit in the CLI, I hate GUI so I dont have any experience in it
[2024-01-11 17:57] <leftyfb> sounds like an opportunity to me
[2024-01-11 17:58] <Guest8> indeed
[2024-01-11 17:58] <Zed`> Question, please: when creating a service is it wrong to have an After= AND a Wants= in the [Unit] ~ Am I being over zealous / dumb / plain old wrong or all of the above... :)
[2024-01-11 17:59] <pragmaticenigma> Zed`: Need more context
[2024-01-11 18:00] <Zed`> pragmaticenigma: I have a service that will absolutely fail if stunnal (a vpn) is not started before it
[2024-01-11 18:01] <leftyfb> Zed`: After means the service won't start until the other does. Wants is a dependency, though not as strict as Requires. The services in Wants= will try to be started first. With After=, those services are just assumed to be started by some other means
[2024-01-11 18:02] <leftyfb> though, even if the services in Wants= don't exit or fail, your main service will still start
[2024-01-11 18:02] <Zed`> ah
[2024-01-11 18:02] <leftyfb> You want Requires= if you NEED those services to exist and start
[2024-01-11 18:03] <Zed`> I see
[2024-01-11 18:03] <Zed`> thank you
[2024-01-11 18:04] <leftyfb> Zed`: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files
[2024-01-11 18:04] <leftyfb> documentation explains all this
[2024-01-11 18:04] <Zed`> awesome thank you again
[2024-01-11 18:05] <Zed`> the computer I am talking to you from is a DO vm
[2024-01-11 18:05] <Zed`> DO is great
[2024-01-11 19:21] <ELFrederich> On my WSL Ubuntu 22.04 VMs I'm able to `apt install nala`, but I have some other VM and I get `Unable to locate package nala`

[2024-01-11 19:30] <leftyfb> URL's don't have upper case
[2024-01-11 19:30] <leftyfb> though I don't think that should break it
[2024-01-11 19:30] <pragmaticenigma> ELFrederich: WSL is not something supported here, and your question would be dependent on the deployment options within windows
[2024-01-11 19:30] <ELFrederich> don't think so either... but you're right, that looks weird
[2024-01-11 19:30] <ELFrederich> pragmaticenigma, it's working within WSL, it's not working on some VM that got provisioned for me
[2024-01-11 19:30] <leftyfb> this isn't a WSL issue. Potentially puppet
[2024-01-11 19:31] <leftyfb> I do't have any experience with not having a sources.list and only relying on .d/ lists. In theory it should work
[2024-01-11 19:31] <ELFrederich> also, if it's not supported here, is there a sub channel where it is?  I think Ubuntu is publishing WSL rootfs images, got into the Microsoft store, etc
[2024-01-11 19:31] <leftyfb> but that is where I would start looking
[2024-01-11 19:31] <leftyfb> !wsl | ELFrederich
[2024-01-11 19:31] <ubottu> ELFrederich: Windows 10 and newer have a feature called "Windows Subsystem for Linux", which allows it to run Ubuntu (and other Linux distro) userspace programs without porting/recompliation. For installation instructions, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide
[2024-01-11 19:32] <ELFrederich> leftyfb, yeah... no issues with WSL.  I'm curious why pragmaticenigma is saying WSL isn't supported in #ubuntu
[2024-01-11 19:33] <leftyfb> ELFrederich: the non-standard kernel and drivers can cause issues
[2024-01-11 19:33] <leftyfb> but this isn't one of them ... .again, I'm pretty sure it's due to your system being managed by puppet
[2024-01-11 19:34] <leftyfb> I would test by moving that .d/ file with the main repo's back into the main sources.list
[2024-01-11 19:34] <ELFrederich> ah... gotcha.  Yeah, I can see not supporting that stuff.  Also graphical apps
[2024-01-11 19:34] <ELFrederich> but CLI stuff, package management, etc should be supported here all day
[2024-01-11 19:34] <oerheks> The package nala in Ubuntu 22.04 is in the jammy-backports repository.?? https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nala/+changelog
[2024-01-11 19:34] <oerheks> from https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nala/+question/706311
[2024-01-11 19:34] <ELFrederich> ah... backports
[2024-01-11 19:35] <leftyfb> damn, missed that
[2024-01-11 19:35] <leftyfb> yep, oerheks is right
[2024-01-11 19:35] <leftyfb> it'd be nice if ubottu gave that info with !info
[2024-01-11 19:35] <ELFrederich> so it wasn't necessisarily universe
[2024-01-11 19:36] <oerheks> ELFrederich, indeed
[2024-01-11 19:36] <oerheks> else it could have been stored in ubuntu's universe project, if it was unmaintained, but does not looke like an abandoned project
[2024-01-11 19:36] <leftyfb> still though, why does puppet wipe the souces.list just to move it into .d/? Seems pointless to me
[2024-01-11 19:45] <pragmaticenigma> ELFrederich: You are correct from the standpoint that core things should be universally supported. However I think you may have encountered the one scenario which makes WSL an outlier. There's a lot of customizations made to those images, by their Author (I assume Microsoft) and in your case, it's possible that WSL enables the backports repo by default, while a general release requires the end user to enable that.
[2024-01-11 19:48] <leftyfb> to be fair, I'm pretty sure the OS image that's used for WSL is just a standard Ubuntu cloud image. The problem's usually stem from the kernel being not a real kernel (WSL1) or a non-standard kernel (WSL2)
[2024-01-11 20:09] <rfm> it's been a while but the last time I looked at WSL2 it had a custom init, didn't use systemd, which is pretty far from a standard ubuntu...
[2024-01-11 21:08] <jake_> hey baby
[2024-01-11 21:12] <ELFrederich> trying out 24.04, noticed gimp finally has a working liquid rescale in there once I installed gimp-plugin-registry, but I can't find the "heal selection"

[2024-01-12 01:28] <Guest26> Ubuntu booting into black screen, so I'm running this live usb.
[2024-01-12 01:29] <Guest26> Here's my system report https://termbin.com/chtv
[2024-01-12 01:30] <Guest26> I ran chroot, but removing nvidia said no nvidia to remove. Nvidia install said latest package is already installed.
[2024-01-12 01:31] <HornySlayer9001> my ubuntu froze
[2024-01-12 01:31] <HornySlayer9001> pls halp
[2024-01-12 01:31] <Guest26> HornySlayer9001reoot?
[2024-01-12 01:31] <Guest26> reboot?
[2024-01-12 01:32] <HornySlayer9001> i dont want
[2024-01-12 01:32] <HornySlayer9001> i have unsaved work
[2024-01-12 01:33] <HornySlayer9001> maybe
[2024-01-12 01:37] <Bashing-om> Guest26: Grub boot menu > advanced options > revovery kernel --- what results ?
[2024-01-12 01:40] <Guest26> HornySlayer9001if you can't get the terminal, doesn't seem to be any other option?
[2024-01-12 01:40] <Guest26> Bashing-omsame black screen.
[2024-01-12 01:41] <Guest26> I assume /dev/sda2 is where the root is? https://dpaste.com/4GTDGG7N6
[2024-01-12 01:44] <Guest26> I tried this, I must be doing something wrong? https://dpaste.com/88WYRPWTU
[2024-01-12 01:44] <Bashing-om> Guest26: Likely - does ' sudo fdisk -lu ' confirm ( asterisc under the boot field) ?
[2024-01-12 01:45] <Guest26> Bashing-om sudo fdisk -lu https://dpaste.com/F9JV32625
[2024-01-12 01:45] <sarnold> HornySlayer9001: ssh in to your computer and see if you can recover things that way?
[2024-01-12 01:46] <sarnold> Guest26: mount points have to exist before you use them
[2024-01-12 01:47] <Guest26> sarnold I did mount and then unmount like this. Is this wrong? https://dpaste.com/88WYRPWTU
[2024-01-12 01:49] <sarnold> Guest26: when you unmounted /mnt that caused the /mnt/dev directory to cease existing
[2024-01-12 01:49] <sarnold> Guest26: I don't know what exactly you're trying to do, but mkdir /dev/mnt ; mount --make-private --rbind /dev /mnt/dev  should let your mount command succeed
[2024-01-12 01:50] <Guest26> sarnold I'm trying to repair Ubuntu's boot from black screen to normal. These are the instructions I've researched: https://dpaste.com/3FUPLHR44
[2024-01-12 01:51] <sarnold> aha
[2024-01-12 01:51] <sarnold> then add in a few more mkdir commands to create /mnt/dev /mnt/proc /mnt/sys /mnt/run
[2024-01-12 01:57] <Guest26> sarnold ok, I made those 4 directories, however new error: https://dpaste.com/DX79WPW5W
[2024-01-12 01:58] <sarnold> Guest26: that might be /usr/bin/bash now
[2024-01-12 01:59] <Guest26> sarnold that failed too https://dpaste.com/3EXRGRHGL
[2024-01-12 02:00] <Guest26> https://dpaste.com/HDVUP6EHX
[2024-01-12 02:00] <sarnold> Guest26: ah dang. what supplies the /mnt/bin/ or /mnt/usr/bin/ in your examples?
[2024-01-12 02:04] <Guest26> sarnold sorry, I'm unsure and a bit lost?
[2024-01-12 02:07] <sarnold> Guest26: hmm, maybe I steered you wrong with those mkdir commands; normally you've got a first mount command to get your main filesystem mounted to /mnt, and I assumed perhaps the other mountpoints underneath were just missing, but maybe that first mount is the one that's missing?
[2024-01-12 02:08] <Guest26> I'll delete those directories
[2024-01-12 02:09] <Guest26> Removing directories says: Operation not permitted.
[2024-01-12 02:11] <sarnold> umount them first
[2024-01-12 02:56] <Necrono> hi

[2024-01-12 03:41] <kotgc> Great! This Live USB only has Internet for a limited time for some reason.
[2024-01-12 03:41] <arraybolt3> WiFi?
[2024-01-12 03:41] <arraybolt3> Might be glitchy firmware or a card that is supported better by a proprietary driver?
[2024-01-12 03:41] <kotgc> arraybolt3 Ethernet cable to router.
[2024-01-12 03:41] <arraybolt3> oof
[2024-01-12 03:42] <arraybolt3> nevermind then, weird
[2024-01-12 03:42] <kotgc> Ubuntu runs network via a KVM, so I'm surprised Live USB has network.
[2024-01-12 03:43] <kotgc> Anyway, Ubuntu's booting to a blackscreen, so I've tried https://dpaste.com/56HK7LTQ7, but issue remains.
[2024-01-12 03:44] <kotgc> Removing Nvidia command said no nvidia to remove. Nvidia install said latest package is already installed.
[2024-01-12 03:48] <kotgc> I tried this, as I think the root is on /dev/sda2? https://dpaste.com/5HVEXJTZR
[2024-01-12 04:25] <kotgc> Here's the system report https://termbin.com/chtv
[2024-01-12 04:26] <kotgc> how to find ubuntu root system? Search results go on about Windows?
[2024-01-12 04:43] <Kangarooo> I got updates and restart did, then in notification was some notification - some language pack not fully something something, i clicked and wanted report bug but it closed. How to remake to popup that language thing?
[2024-01-12 04:43] <Kangarooo> it was asking for password, i wanted to enter later, and i got error, that password was not provided
[2024-01-12 05:01] <kotgc> Kangarooo uninstall the package and reinstall it.
[2024-01-12 05:36] <Kangarooo> kotgc: i did updates and then that came, so i dont know what language package it is. Oh, now after restart it came back again. Full text- System notificaton helper. Language support is incomplete, additional pakcages are required. Now when i didnt enter password in some 10 or 20 seconds then got error
[2024-01-12 05:37] <Kangarooo> This operation cannot continue since proper authorization was not provided.
[2024-01-12 05:38] <kotgc> Kangarooo good, that's the prompt you were looking for right?
[2024-01-12 05:39] <Kangarooo> Yes @kotgc it should not have timeout or should come back to notification if not entered in time and have countdown time.
[2024-01-12 08:46] <stenno> should i buy an apple vision pro
[2024-01-12 08:46] <stenno> oops sorry
[2024-01-12 08:46] <stenno> wrong channel
[2024-01-12 11:18] <salve> Hi all
[2024-01-12 12:09] <ph88> How can i change the standard terminal? I already tried this command sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
[2024-01-12 12:09] <ph88> the right terminal won't be used when i launch a launcher file with Terminal=true
[2024-01-12 12:22] <Paris> there is maybe an option in your term prefs to set it as default, like for browser.
[2024-01-12 12:23] <Paris> maybe in the settings, not sure tho.
[2024-01-12 12:24] <tomreyn> ph88: tough one. i don't know whether these statements are correct, but https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=2107886#p2107886 seems to say xdg tooling lacks a setting for this, so, at this time, what to launch for Terminal=true depends on whatever launches the process, which would be the graphical desktop, which would be gnome in your case (if you're on default Ubuntu).
[2024-01-12 12:24] <tomreyn> but the default terminal emulator does not appear to be configurable in gnome either.
[2024-01-12 12:27] <tomreyn> hmm, although there is a setting:     org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec 'x-terminal-emulator'
[2024-01-12 12:28] <tomreyn> and (assuming this gnome setting is taken into account when 'launching' .desktop files) x-terminal-emulator should apply the alternatives configuration
[2024-01-12 12:31] <ph88> DEPRECATED: This key is deprecated and ignored. The default terminal is handled in GIO.
[2024-01-12 12:31] <ph88> what is GIO ?
[2024-01-12 12:32] <tomreyn> it comes with a man page
[2024-01-12 12:32] <ph88> what comes with man page ?
[2024-01-12 12:32] <tomreyn> "gio"
[2024-01-12 12:33] <ph88> not sure what GIO has to do with this
[2024-01-12 12:33] <ph88> https://imgur.com/a/zxL2vPc
[2024-01-12 12:35] <tomreyn> https://developer-old.gnome.org/gio/unstable/ch01.html
[2024-01-12 12:36] <tomreyn> i don't see it stated anywhere, but i guess GIO just stands for Gnome input/output library or something close to that
[2024-01-12 12:38] <ph88> And i should set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal through that somehow ?
[2024-01-12 12:40] <tomreyn> i think the deprecation notice on the screenshot you posted hints that it is not gsettings which defines what gnome will default to for the terminal emulator, but something somehow configured in gio (if such exists).
[2024-01-12 12:40] <tomreyn> that's all i know
[2024-01-12 12:42] <tomreyn> https://askubuntu.com/questions/111592/how-do-i-set-the-default-terminal-in-gnome looks informative
[2024-01-12 12:44] <tomreyn> "dpkg -S xdg-terminal-exec" returns an empty result set for me (but i'm running debian right now).
[2024-01-12 12:49] <tomreyn> ph88: so you can try the symlink suggestion provided there. i would just pick the users' (not system wide) bin directory what's in PATH (I have ~/.local/bin):    echo $PATH | sed 's/:/\n/g' | grep bin
[2024-01-12 12:51] <tomreyn> so assuming I wanted to use the lilyterm terminal emulator I'd     ln -s /usr/bin/lilyterm ~/.local/bin/xdg-terminal-exec
[2024-01-12 12:54] <tomreyn> !info libglib2.0-bin jammy

[2024-01-12 12:57] <tomreyn> so jammy's gio also has the terminal emulators to look for hardcoded, but differently: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/2.72.4/gio/gdesktopappinfo.c?ref_type=tags#L2356-2688
[2024-01-12 12:57] <tomreyn> i don't even know which ubuntu release you're using, though
[2024-01-12 13:01] <tomreyn> correct link for jammy: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/2.72.4/gio/gdesktopappinfo.c?ref_type=tags#L2653-2688
[2024-01-12 13:02] <tomreyn> (this is upstream code - could be modified in ubuntu)
[2024-01-12 13:11] <ph88> hey tomreyn thanks for the help. By the way i'm on 23.10 Mantic Minotaur
[2024-01-12 13:12] <tomreyn> ph88: do you know how to look up the code for it then?

[2024-01-12 13:15] <ph88> the code looks very different but xdg-terminal-exec is first so i think your suggestion should work
[2024-01-12 13:15] <tomreyn> exactly. :) same upstream code as we looked at originally.
[2024-01-12 13:16] <tomreyn> https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/commit/eb2d1d8fc894ae7ebba24019f670e32fc48c031e is the commit which changed the branching there
[2024-01-12 13:17] <ph88> i made the symlink, it didn't work .. would i need to login again ?
[2024-01-12 13:17] <tomreyn> hmm, likely so
[2024-01-12 13:17] <tomreyn> but i haven't tried it myself
[2024-01-12 13:18] <ph88> ok brb then i will reboot pc
[2024-01-12 13:21] <ph88> tomreyn, rebooted .. still at old terminal :(
[2024-01-12 13:22] <tomreyn> dang. and if you run xdg-terminal-exec manually, do you get the right terminal emulator?
[2024-01-12 13:22] <ph88> yes
[2024-01-12 13:22] <tomreyn> so maybe ubuntu's code differs there
[2024-01-12 13:23] <ph88> where would the right code be ?
[2024-01-12 13:24] <tomreyn> somewhere over here, i guess https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glib2.0
[2024-01-12 13:27] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-12 13:28] <tomreyn> ph88: looks like the same code - *IF* i chose the right branch: https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glib2.0/tree/gio/gdesktopappinfo.c?h=applied/ubuntu/mantic#n2702
[2024-01-12 13:29] <tomreyn> i never really know how to tell *reliably* which repository and branch a given distro's binary package was built from
[2024-01-12 13:35] <Guest4241> a
[2024-01-12 13:36] <aturkedjiev50> hello
[2024-01-12 13:36] <aturkedjiev50> whats up
[2024-01-12 13:36] <asdf> this is my hexchat
[2024-01-12 13:36] <asdf> ik you see this
[2024-01-12 13:36] <asdf> dont run
[2024-01-12 13:51] <ph88> tomreyn, perhaps it's something in the launcher code
[2024-01-12 13:52] <tomreyn> ph88: what other than gio would be "the launcher"?
[2024-01-12 13:53] <ph88> i don't know :(
[2024-01-12 13:53] <tomreyn> i mean, it seems that gdesktopappinfo.c is what gnome-shell uses to interpret .desktop files and decide how to launch them. so this does seem to be the relevant part. there *could* be other code overriding that, sure.
[2024-01-12 13:56] <kotgc> Hello, anyone know how to fix Ubuntu booting to black screen please?
[2024-01-12 13:58] <tomreyn> kotgc: we'll need more information to help there.
[2024-01-12 13:59] <kotgc> tomreyn I removed SSD 3 of 4 which is an empty disk and connected a LinuxMint SSD to test if the LinuxMint SSD was fried or not. The LinuxMint SSD ran perfectly.
[2024-01-12 13:59] <tomreyn> kotgc: which ubuntu is this, what may have introduced this issue - did you make changes, install third party software, install updates or upgrades, or is this a fresh install?
[2024-01-12 13:59] <kotgc> I then shutdown, disconnected the LinuxMint SSD and reconnected SSD 3 of 4.
[2024-01-12 13:59] <kotgc> Ubuntu 22.04.3.
[2024-01-12 14:00] <kotgc> tomreyn can I share the forum post about it, as I have made some log outputs?
[2024-01-12 14:00] <tomreyn> kotgc: so if you reverse these changes, does it boot fine again?
[2024-01-12 14:00] <tomreyn> kotgc: sure, if it's just one url
[2024-01-12 14:01] <kotgc> No, Ubuntu boots 3 lines of dmesg, then black screen. When I say black screen, not like power off, but there's power but no output.
[2024-01-12 14:01] <kotgc> tomreyn https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2494247
[2024-01-12 14:05] <tomreyn> kotgc: this sounds like you replaced disks while the system was running? at least you do explicitly mention that you shutdown at some point but not at another where you replaced disks.
[2024-01-12 14:06] <tomreyn> that's just a side note, but don't do this unless you know all parts of your system which are relevant for this are fine with you doing so.
[2024-01-12 14:07] <kotgc> tomreyn yes, I shutdown each time changing SSDs.
[2024-01-12 14:07] <kotgc> I thought the system would be fine, but apparently not.
[2024-01-12 14:08] <kotgc> I have 4 more disks to test, as a storm on 25th December 2023 fried a computer's MOBO, RAM or CPU. So I'm testing disks now.
[2024-01-12 14:09] <kotgc> Computer wasn't behind a surge protector.
[2024-01-12 14:12] <tomreyn> kotgc: i'm still reading your post, got distracted. you tried recovery mode and got a black screen as well?
[2024-01-12 14:12] <kotgc> tomreyn yes, so I'm on LiveUSB right now.
[2024-01-12 14:13] <tomreyn> kotgc: for future reference, don't run startx with sudo
[2024-01-12 14:13] <kotgc> tomreyn ok, I won't remember that, I'll try to note it somewhere.
[2024-01-12 14:13] <tomreyn> kotgc: how were you able to run commands when you say you're stuck with a black screen?
[2024-01-12 14:14] <kotgc> tomreyn grub menu, e to edit boot and LiveUSB.
[2024-01-12 14:14] <kotgc> Ubuntu boots with 3 lines of dmesg and black screen.
[2024-01-12 14:14] <kotgc> *then
[2024-01-12 14:16] <tomreyn> kotgc: i think i will need to read the entire thread first, didn't realize you got this going for days already. if i have anything to add i'll post on the forum.
[2024-01-12 14:16] <kotgc> tomreyn ok, thank you.
[2024-01-12 14:16] <kotgc> I'm out of ideas.
[2024-01-12 14:22] <tomreyn> you'Re writing that "Ubuntu recovery mode just boots to a black screen and in command prompt, ping 1.1.1.1 fails." - so this seems to say you CAN run commands from the recovery shell?
[2024-01-12 14:24] <kotgc> tomreyn sorry, that would be from grub I'd say? I was a bit overwhelmed at the start. I might have to go back and clarify my misunderstandings.
[2024-01-12 14:25] <kotgc> which post# please?
[2024-01-12 14:26] <tomreyn> kotgc: try this: remove the live usb stick, boot normally from the internal disk, trying to boot the ubuntu installation, bring up the grub menu, select the "recovery" option. tell me whether you reach the text menu where you can select some options.
[2024-01-12 14:26] <tomreyn> please use a different computer or mobile device to remain on the chat
[2024-01-12 14:27] <kotgc> tomreyn yes, I do reach the option for recovery and other options. That's where I ran the command line (not from grub).
[2024-01-12 14:29] <tomreyn> kotgc: select the "network" option
[2024-01-12 14:29] <tomreyn> then the "root" option
[2024-01-12 14:29] <kotgc> tomreyn ok, I updated post #1, line 5.
[2024-01-12 14:30] <kotgc> tomreyn ok, shutting down, might have problems with phone irc.
[2024-01-12 14:39] <kotgc> tomreyn yes, recovery mode -> network -> root -> circles back to recovery mode.
[2024-01-12 14:40] <tomreyn> kotgc: you mean you end up on the text menu again?
[2024-01-12 14:40] <kotgc> tomreyn yes
[2024-01-12 14:41] <tomreyn> that would be expected for the "network" option, but when you chose the "root" option, it should ask you a question below the menu
[2024-01-12 14:41] <tomreyn> does it not do so?
[2024-01-12 14:42] <tomreyn> more precisely, after selecting the "root" option it should print "press enter for meintenance" below the menu
[2024-01-12 14:42] <kotgc> tomreyn options are Yes or No. I select Yes which IIRC boots to root or something?
[2024-01-12 14:42] <tomreyn> kotgc: where / when do you see options "Yes or No"?
[2024-01-12 14:42] <kotgc> I think we're in different locations. I have been in the edit area too.
[2024-01-12 14:43] <tomreyn> are you on the grub menu by chance?
[2024-01-12 14:43] <kotgc> Right now I'm back in LiveUSB.
[2024-01-12 14:43] <tomreyn> can you not access this chat from a different device then?
[2024-01-12 14:43] <tomreyn> so that we can chat while you boot from the installed system
[2024-01-12 14:44] <kotgc> the phone is tricky. I can try again.
[2024-01-12 14:44] <tomreyn> what makes it tricky?
[2024-01-12 14:45] <tomreyn> which chat client are you using on the phone?
[2024-01-12 14:45] <kotgcFromPhone> Test
[2024-01-12 14:45] <tomreyn> this seems to work
[2024-01-12 14:46] <kotgc> Ok, phone IRC is working...I was shopping around for IRC apps, but the website was problematic, but I might have figured it out now.
[2024-01-12 14:46] <tomreyn> https://web.libera.chat/?nick=kotgphone#ubuntu is a shortcut if you need it
[2024-01-12 14:46] <kotgc> Shall I go back to the grub?
[2024-01-12 14:47] <tomreyn> yes, to grub, boot the recovery option and tell me what you get
[2024-01-12 14:48] <tomreyn> i'm trying to get you here https://hackernoon.imgix.net/hn-images/1*qm3DD1pRygY9oaPY9jIFoQ.png
[2024-01-12 14:49] <tomreyn> so from grub, you select "Advanced options for Ubuntu", then the first one which says "... (recovery mode)"
[2024-01-12 14:50] <kotgc> ok
[2024-01-12 14:50] <tomreyn> which should then bring you to a colored text menu which says "Recovery Menu (...)" on top
[2024-01-12 14:51] <tomreyn> <tomreyn> so from grub, you select "Advanced options for Ubuntu", then the first one which says "... (recovery mode)"
[2024-01-12 14:51] <tomreyn> <tomreyn> which should then bring you to a colored text menu which says "Recovery Menu (...)" on top
[2024-01-12 14:51] <kotgcFromPhone> I see 8 recovery mode options in a text menu
[2024-01-12 14:52] <tomreyn> does it say "GNU GRUB" on top of this screen?
[2024-01-12 14:52] <kotgcFromPhone> No, the pink screen showsâ¦
[2024-01-12 14:52] <tomreyn> or does it say "Recovery Menu (...)" on top of this screen?
[2024-01-12 14:53] <tomreyn> kotgcFromPhone: ?
[2024-01-12 14:53] <kotgcFromPhone> resume, clean, dpkg, fsck, grub, network, root and system-summary.
[2024-01-12 14:53] <kotgcFromPhone> Yes
[2024-01-12 14:53] <tomreyn> okay. select the "network" option
[2024-01-12 14:53] <kotgcFromPhone> Done
[2024-01-12 14:54] <tomreyn> now select the "root" option
[2024-01-12 14:54] <kotgcFromPhone> Continuing will remount your / filesystemâ¦
[2024-01-12 14:54] <kotgcFromPhone> Only Yes or No
[2024-01-12 14:55] <tomreyn> hmm, i'm not familiar with this message, but select "Yes"
[2024-01-12 14:55] <kotgcFromPhone> So Iâm back in the text menu
[2024-01-12 14:55] <tomreyn> select the "root" option
[2024-01-12 14:56] <tomreyn> and i just understood why you got this question
[2024-01-12 14:56] <tomreyn> does it say "Press Enter for maintenance" below the menu now?
[2024-01-12 14:57] <kotgcFromPhone> Yes
[2024-01-12 14:57] <tomreyn> so press enter
[2024-01-12 14:57] <kotgcFromPhone> Iâm at command prompt now
[2024-01-12 14:57] <tomreyn> now type this and press enter: ping -c1 1.1.1.1
[2024-01-12 14:58] <kotgcFromPhone> Network is unreachable
[2024-01-12 14:58] <tomreyn> looks like it
[2024-01-12 15:02] <kotgcFromPhone> Test
[2024-01-12 15:13] <Pricey> I have a /48 at my openwrt router. It delegates from a /64 to everything on the lan. On an Ubuntu box, I create an lxd network with a different /64 via lxc network set ipv6.address. How do I get other machines on the lan to know where that second /64 is? I can set a static route on the router/gateway which seems to work well enough, but isn't that traffic then heading through it? When it could be across
[2024-01-12 15:13] <Pricey> the link direct to the ubuntu box?
[2024-01-12 15:15] <leftyfb> when you say a /48 and a /64, I assume you're referring to ipv6
[2024-01-12 15:16] <leftyfb> Pricey: but to answer your question, you want to create a bridge
[2024-01-12 15:17] <Pricey> And I'm assuming you don't mean an lxd network of type bridge.
[2024-01-12 15:17] <leftyfb> no, a network bridge separate from lxd, that your lxd containers will utilize though
[2024-01-12 15:18] <ravage> lxd can use an existing bridge interface
[2024-01-12 15:18] <ravage> you can select that during "lxd init"
[2024-01-12 15:19] <leftyfb> only do that if you want all containers to utilize that bridge by default
[2024-01-12 15:19] <leftyfb> the setting up during init
[2024-01-12 15:19] <leftyfb> regardless. Pricey:  https://thenewstack.io/how-to-create-a-bridged-network-for-lxd-containers/
[2024-01-12 15:19] <leftyfb> though you'll have to translate this into ipv6
[2024-01-12 15:19] <leftyfb> which I don't have any experience with
[2024-01-12 15:22] <Pricey> I'm certain there's a better way of doing this in the ipv6 world.
[2024-01-12 15:23] <leftyfb> I don't think so
[2024-01-12 15:23] <faceface> hello
[2024-01-12 15:23] <leftyfb> Pricey: but you can always try asking in #networking
[2024-01-12 15:23] <faceface> I'm running Distro: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) on 3 server boxes. I read about 'synchronising' apt via UbuntuOne... is that still the right way to do it?
[2024-01-12 15:24] <Pricey> With a static route added to my gateway, everything works just fine. No need to add a different network interface on the ubuntu server to bridge the lxd network.
[2024-01-12 15:24] <faceface> https://askubuntu.com/questions/20916/syncing-apt-get-installations-between-multiple-computers#:~:text=Ubuntu%20Software%20Center%20has%20a,with%20your%20Ubuntu%20One%20account.
[2024-01-12 15:24] <faceface> hi Pricey
[2024-01-12 15:24] <Pricey> I might do.
[2024-01-12 15:24] <leftyfb> Pricey: Then what are you asking for help with exactly if you have it working?
[2024-01-12 15:25] <faceface> I can't run 'ubuntu-software' on that machine :-/
[2024-01-12 15:25] <leftyfb> faceface: why not?
[2024-01-12 15:25] <Pricey> Because I'm certain there's a better ipv6'y way to do this than a static route on the gateway. My understanding of this method is that everything on my lan is sending the traffic to the gateway, which then forwards it to the ubuntu box on the lan. I'm trying to figure out how to get stuff on the lan to know there's something link local it can send traffic to instead.
[2024-01-12 15:25] <faceface> $ ubuntu-software
[2024-01-12 15:25] <faceface> ubuntu-software: command not found
[2024-01-12 15:26] <leftyfb> faceface: open it from the icon
[2024-01-12 15:26] <faceface> apt search ubuntu-software # No Joy
[2024-01-12 15:26] <faceface> leftyfb: these are servers where I'm sshed -X'ed in
[2024-01-12 15:26] <faceface> Not sure if there is a better way to sync across boxes...
[2024-01-12 15:27] <faceface> but the suggestion of ubuntuOne in that thread looks good to me (if I can start the gui...
[2024-01-12 15:27] <leftyfb> faceface: then there should be no expectation of graphical tools
[2024-01-12 15:27] <faceface> leftyfb: indeed, but here we are ;-)
[2024-01-12 15:29] <leftyfb> faceface: are these 3x servers publicly facing?
[2024-01-12 15:29] <faceface> I can just list packages on each mahcine and somehow sync, but the ubuntu one seems neat
[2024-01-12 15:29] <faceface> leftyfb: yup
[2024-01-12 15:30] <leftyfb> faceface: if you were to ask me, remove any sort of graphical environment and use a proper sysadmin tool like ansible, chef or salt to manage them
[2024-01-12 15:30] <faceface> yeah
[2024-01-12 15:30] <faceface> that's reasonable
[2024-01-12 15:44] <Pricey> leftyfb: Aha! I think that what I wanted was radvd... but advertising routes not prefixes. After setting that up I seem to have a nice route on the clients in my lan direct to the machine.
[2024-01-12 15:44] <Pricey> No changes to actual networking interfaces reuqired.
[2024-01-12 15:46] <Pricey> I don't think my openwrt is set up to follow RA's for obvious reasons, so will just need to add a route on that and I think I'll be sorted.
[2024-01-12 15:46] <leftyfb> Pricey: I prefer to have critical infrastructure configs under revision control
[2024-01-12 15:46] <Pricey> Configuring my ubuntu host from ansible which should count?
[2024-01-12 15:49] <leftyfb> Pricey: right. I'm referring to you wanting the config on the router. I guess it's made easier, though less secure being openwrt
[2024-01-12 15:50] <Pricey> I have no idea what you're talking about now :-)
[2024-01-12 15:52] <leftyfb> Pricey: your choices are to add the routes to the client, in which case keeping the configs under revision control is fine. Or setting the static routes on your router, in which case you'll have to enable ssh on the router to allow for keeping it's configs under revision control
[2024-01-12 15:54] <Pricey> Right, my point is that I've just achieved neither of those :-)
[2024-01-12 15:54] <Pricey> I have worked out I can use radvd on my server to advertise to clients. Nothing on the router or the clients.
[2024-01-12 16:22] <howudodat> I am trying to setup a nfs4 server integrated into AD, should I ask here or #ubuntu-server?
[2024-01-12 16:45] <GrandPa-G> I created a partition with a command similar to dd if=/dev/zero of=usbcontainer.img bs=1M count=4096 then I sudo mkdosfs /home/ap/usbcontainer.img to make dos partition. I want to delete the partition and start over. I don't see how with fdisk
[2024-01-12 16:49] <faceface> GrandPa-G: partd?
[2024-01-12 16:51] <GrandPa-G> I will give that a try shortly. I must mention this is for a Pi zero lite, command line only
[2024-01-12 16:59] <faceface> Luxury!
[2024-01-12 17:08] <plujon> Greetings.  I'm on Ubuntu 22, and I just updated several packages on my system because the Software Updater popped up as I was working, and I hit <Enter> trying to complete a task, which started the update process.  I want to disable the Software Updater popups, but I'm unclear on terminology.
[2024-01-12 17:09] <tomreyn> !yy.mm| plujon
[2024-01-12 17:09] <ubottu> plujon: Ubuntu version numbers are: YY.MM (YY=release year,MM=release month). Each year sees two releases, so just specifying YY is imprecise. See also https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle
[2024-01-12 17:09] <plujon> 22.04 LTS
[2024-01-12 17:10] <plujon> Is it possible to disable the periodic Software Updater window from popping up using some command line incantation?
[2024-01-12 17:11] <tomreyn> the pop-up should have a "settings" button on the bottom left
[2024-01-12 17:12] <tomreyn> you can bring this up by selecting the "Software & Updates" (blue icon) from activities
[2024-01-12 17:12] <plujon> tomreyn: Thanks, I've clicked on that.  I guess I should just set Automatic check for updates to "Never"..?
[2024-01-12 17:13] <tomreyn> i guess it's worth a try. but then you won't get any updates, which is a security risk for any system accessing the internet
[2024-01-12 17:13] <plujon> Is there some other way to avoid the pop ups?
[2024-01-12 17:14] <tomreyn> yes, you could use what the server variant uses for upgrading
[2024-01-12 17:14] <tomreyn> unattended-upgrades
[2024-01-12 17:14] <tomreyn> it's an apt package you can install
[2024-01-12 17:14] <plujon> Does that also set motd?
[2024-01-12 17:15] <tomreyn> i'm not actually sure, i think the process which updates motd is separate
[2024-01-12 17:15] <tomreyn> you should have configuration snippets for both in /etc/apt/conf.d/
[2024-01-12 17:16] <tomreyn> so there is /etc/apt/conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
[2024-01-12 17:17] <tomreyn> also 99update-notifier, which i think triggers the desktop pop-up
[2024-01-12 17:18] <plujon> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades # exists
[2024-01-12 17:18] <plujon> I periodically do: apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
[2024-01-12 17:21] <tomreyn> unattaneded-upgrades is a lot better than this
[2024-01-12 17:23] <tomreyn> if you want the updated motd but not the ads then you can try this: https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/v29/howtoguides/disable_enable_apt_news.html
[2024-01-12 17:24] <tomreyn> (i just tried this on 22.04 and while the command exited with status code 0, the actual setting did not change)
[2024-01-12 17:25] <tomreyn> oh, it works, i should have run it with sudo
[2024-01-12 17:26] <tomreyn> there is also /etc/update-motd.d/
[2024-01-12 18:51] <Guest2790> hi
[2024-01-12 19:02] <ddksj> is there a network installer or something? i don't want a 4 gb iso

[2024-01-12 19:06] <antonio_> hi
[2024-01-12 19:24] <arraybolt3> oerheks, ddksj: note that the new mini.iso *does* download a 4gb or so ISO.
[2024-01-12 19:26] <leftyfb> is it an iso or an image? (cloud?)
[2024-01-12 19:26] <leftyfb> pretty pointless to boot to a 100MB iso just for it to pull down a 4G iso and perform the same installation from said iso
[2024-01-12 20:31] <ddksj> the installer fails for the third time a row
[2024-01-12 20:38] <ioria> ddksj, doyou want my suggestion ?
[2024-01-12 20:39] <ddksj> yes?
[2024-01-12 20:39] <ioria> ddksj, install 20.04 mini.iso (legacy); then try to upgrade (if you want): http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/
[2024-01-12 20:41] <ioria> ddksj, cabled connection, no uefi
[2024-01-12 20:44] <plujon> Greetings; I'm trying out docker today, and I notice that while `docker` runs, `docker compose` does not exist.  Is this normal?
[2024-01-12 20:45] <leftyfb> plujon: sudo apt install docker-compose
[2024-01-12 20:49] <plujon> leftyfb: Ah.  I notice there's docker-compose-v2 as well.  I'll do some reading.  Thanks.
[2024-01-12 20:49] <Whiskey`> ok this smooth brained ape needs some help with a fresh install. X is failing but is not writing the error to the log file.
[2024-01-12 20:50] <Whiskey`> where to start to get a proper error output?
[2024-01-12 20:52] <Whiskey`> https://pastebin.com/KkG7V5ra
[2024-01-12 20:52] <Whiskey`> thats the end of the log file, and no EE's are found
[2024-01-12 20:59] <oerheks> Xorg has configured a multihead system ... fresh install?
[2024-01-12 21:02] <Whiskey`> yup
[2024-01-12 21:02] <Whiskey`> and... changing the primary to the onboard gpu at least let it start
[2024-01-12 21:03] <Whiskey`> but no mouse or kbd working hmmm
[2024-01-12 21:04] <Whiskey`> well its progress
[2024-01-12 21:10] <Whiskey`> ok thats stupid. after changing the primary gpu and reconfiguing x, it works
[2024-01-12 21:10] <Whiskey`> sorta confused about why the log file sys it exited with errors but did not contain those errors
[2024-01-12 21:43] <ddksj> how do you create fstab in ubuntu?
[2024-01-12 21:53] <Whiskey`> it should be automatic
[2024-01-12 21:55] <leftyfb> ddksj: install ubuntu. That creates /etc/fstab by default
[2024-01-12 21:56] <causative> my lock screen says "click or press a key to unlock" but actually only a *click* will unlock. I can type my password normally after I click the mouse to unlock. Fixable?
[2024-01-12 21:56] <Whiskey`> what happens if you press some key first
[2024-01-12 21:56] <causative> nothing
[2024-01-12 21:57] <causative> it doesn't get past the "click or press a key to unlock" screen unless I specifically click
[2024-01-12 21:57] <Whiskey`> even if you press enter?
[2024-01-12 21:57] <causative> yes even if I press enter
[2024-01-12 21:58] <oerheks> space should work
[2024-01-12 21:58] <causative> it doesn't
[2024-01-12 21:58] <Whiskey`> sounds like the kbd is not sending strokes, or at least not being received by the lock screen
[2024-01-12 21:59] <causative> also I don't even get the "click or press a key to unlock" screen unless the screen times out and locks that way, if I specifically select "lock screen" from the top right menu it will go to a lock screen showing the time *without* that message, and from that particular lock screen the kbd does work
[2024-01-12 22:02] <causative> but I just tested by setting screen timeout to 1min and waiting, and when locked that way, no key gets past it. not esc, enter, space, any qwerty key, none of the function keys do anything until I click the mouse
[2024-01-12 22:02] <floorcrawler> had issue with qemu not able to make a usb passthrough "usb-host not a valid device".  Decided to compile qemu with --enable-libusb as suggested but the issue persists..
[2024-01-12 22:02] <floorcrawler> Ubuntu 22
[2024-01-12 22:04] <floorcrawler> nevermind, i forgot to run the new binary
[2024-01-12 22:30] <tomreyn> causative: which ubuntu version are you running there? which display manager? i just tried locking the screen on 22.04 and then pressing a key. doing so brings up the password entry screen, and pressing enter unlocks the screen.
[2024-01-12 22:30] <tomreyn> this is on wayland
[2024-01-12 22:30] <causative> 22.04 on Xorg
[2024-01-12 22:31] <causative> but as I said, just locking the screen from the menu does not cause this bug
[2024-01-12 22:31] <causative> only if it locks from screen timeout
[2024-01-12 22:32] <tomreyn> i see. i did not read you writing that it does not happen if you manually lock the screen.
[2024-01-12 22:36] <tomreyn> causative: i don't see a difference. maybe this is Xorg related, have you tried wayland?
[2024-01-12 22:37] <causative> I am using xorg because wayland did not have a good way for me to remote desktop into it from my phone
[2024-01-12 22:37] <causative> not gonna switch because I care much more about being able to do that, than I care about having to click the mouse when I sit down
[2024-01-12 22:40] <tomreyn> hmm, it also works on xorg for me
[2024-01-12 22:40] <tomreyn> maybe something is special about your setup
[2024-01-12 22:42] <causative> well, I have the assistive kbd setting turned on, maybe that's interfering somehow, although it does not appear on the lock screen
[2024-01-12 22:43] <tomreyn> do you have any gnome-shell extensions which could affect it?
[2024-01-12 22:44] <causative> yeah I had that one to allow rdp from the lock screen
[2024-01-12 22:45] <tomreyn> maybe try without that one then
[2024-01-12 22:45] <tomreyn> just to see whether it's causing it
[2024-01-12 22:50] <causative> that must have been it, thanks!
[2024-01-12 23:58] <kotgc> Hello, anyone know how to fix Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS black screen?
[2024-01-13 00:02] <leftyfb> kotgc: you've been at this for 3 days. It will be WAY easier to just install Ubuntu 22.04 from scratch and restore from backup
[2024-01-13 00:04] <kotgc> leftyfb that means rebuilding a KVM router, tunnels, network etc
[2024-01-13 00:05] <leftyfb> kotgc: then it's a good thing you have it documented, scripted or a playbook built with ansible
[2024-01-13 00:05] <kotgc> leftyfb plus, I still have 4 more disks to test for damage after the 25th December 2023 storms that blew up a computer. So I need to fix as the issue will probably repeat.
[2024-01-13 00:06] <kotgc> leftyfb What's ansible? It's all on the forums.
[2024-01-13 00:06] <kotgc> Ants in your pants?
[2024-01-13 00:06] <kotgc> Risible?
[2024-01-13 00:06] <leftyfb> kotgc: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/index.html
[2024-01-13 00:07] <leftyfb> kotgc: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-20-04
[2024-01-13 00:08] <kotgc> leftyfb I don't how that FOSS IT automation will help?
[2024-01-13 00:08] <leftyfb> you would build a playbook that would rebuild your system just by running 1 command
[2024-01-13 00:09] <leftyfb> I just built a playbook to rebuild my work laptop from scratch, restoring from backup and reconfiguring every single customization I've done to it including installing and reconfiguring all the packages I had installed
[2024-01-13 00:10] <leftyfb> and it would do so in just a few minutes ... depending on how much data you were restoring from backup, or if
[2024-01-13 00:11] <leftyfb> in the meantime, it will still be quicker to just rebuild it
[2024-01-13 00:17] <kotgc> leftyfb reason 3: curiosity to find what the problem is.
[2024-01-13 00:17] <kotgc> leftyfbÂ  reason 4: see if it can be fixed by experts.
[2024-01-13 00:17] <kotgc> reason 5: I'm not confident this Ansible thingy 'just works'.
[2024-01-13 00:18] <kotgc> reason 6: running this Ansible thingy 5 more times for the other disks I test doesn't sound like the best plan.
[2024-01-13 00:19] <leftyfb> kotgc: that's exactly why ansible was built
[2024-01-13 00:19] <leftyfb> and yes, it "just works" if you build your playbook to do what you need it to do
[2024-01-13 00:19] <leftyfb> kotgc: regardless, your issue is likely due to your power outage. Either something on your drive is corrupt and not easily repairable or you have a hardware issue as a result
[2024-01-13 00:20] <kotgc> leftyfb no, the storm was at another place, not here.
[2024-01-13 00:21] <leftyfb> kotgc: so why is your computer having a problem now? What changed?
[2024-01-13 00:21] <kotgc> I removed SSD 3 of 4 which is an empty disk and connected a LinuxMint SSD to test if the LinuxMint SSD was fried or not. The LinuxMint SSD ran perfectly.
[2024-01-13 00:21] <kotgc> I then shutdown, disconnected the LinuxMint SSD and reconnected SSD 3 of 4.
[2024-01-13 00:22] <leftyfb> kotgc: remove all drives except the Ubuntu drive and try a boot repair
[2024-01-13 00:22] <leftyfb> !bootrepair | kotgc
[2024-01-13 00:22] <ubottu> kotgc: Boot-Repair is a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues you may encounter in Ubuntu. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair for more info.
[2024-01-13 00:24] <elliotanderson> hello
[2024-01-13 00:25] <kotgc> leftyfb ok, reading up on the boot thingy.
[2024-01-13 00:25] <elliotanderson> wow this is awsome
[2024-01-13 00:26] <elliotanderson> like lubuntu bruhhh
[2024-01-13 00:26] <leftyfb> kotgc: going forward, I would seriously look at ansible. It's purpose built for your exact purpose. Rebuild systems from scratch. You can even build it to run the same playbook to build multiple distro's in the same way
[2024-01-13 00:26] <elliotanderson> can like ammm create a chat for me and my friends?
[2024-01-13 00:26] <kotgc> leftyfb thanks, I'll put it on the ToDo list.
[2024-01-13 00:27] <leftyfb> elliotanderson: feel free to ask for help with that in #libera. This is an Ubuntu support channel
[2024-01-13 00:27] <kotgc> elliotanderson this is tech support, other channels are for chat.
[2024-01-13 00:28] <elliotanderson> oh ok thanks
[2024-01-13 00:41] <kotgc> leftyfb rn the Boot Repair, it said it fixed it, rebooted and same black screen issue.
[2024-01-13 00:41] <kotgc> *ran
[2024-01-13 00:42] <kotgc> I'll email BootRepair, as per instructions if it didn't fix it.
[2024-01-13 00:43] <kotgc> I'm confused what is the bootable drive though. It's either sda1 or sda2?
[2024-01-13 00:43] <leftyfb> kotgc: so you didn't actually do what I told you
[2024-01-13 00:43] <leftyfb> oh wait, sda1 or sda2
[2024-01-13 00:43] <kotgc> I was 50% sure /dev/sda2 was the boot drive, but Boot Repair says this
[2024-01-13 00:43] <kotgc> Locked-NVram detected. Please do not forget to make your UEFI firmware boot on the Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS entry (sda1/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file) !
[2024-01-13 00:43] <leftyfb> did you remove all the other drives?
[2024-01-13 00:44] <kotgc> leftyfb oh, not yet, I'll try that.
[2024-01-13 00:44] <leftyfb> kotgc: remove all drives except the Ubuntu drive and try a boot repair
[2024-01-13 00:44] <kotgc> leftyfb ok
[2024-01-13 00:59] <rjwiii> Ubuntu 22.04. Installed MusicPod via SNAP ... Click on the icon and nothing happens. I am able to start it via CLI ... Any ideas?
[2024-01-13 01:08] <kotgc> leftyfb ok, ran Boot Repair with only 1 of 4 disks connected, however same outcome.

[2024-01-13 04:51] <kotgc> Hello, on which file would I run the fsck command? /dev/sda2 or something else?
[2024-01-13 04:54] <kotgc> Can I run fsck from live usb in chroot, or do I need to boot into the machine's grub?
[2024-01-13 04:59] <Bashing-om> kotgc: fsck from another instance rather than the install - the target of fsck must be in an unmounted condition.
[2024-01-13 05:00] <kotgc> Bashing-om whoa what? So do I run the command $ fsck /dev/ sda2 from Ubuntu's grub or from LiveUSB's chroot?
[2024-01-13 05:03] <Bashing-om> kotgc: Neither !
[2024-01-13 05:03] <kotgc> Bashing-om just looking up how I can tell if /dev/sda2 is mounted or unmounted.
[2024-01-13 05:04] <Bashing-om> kotgc: If you are change rooted in -- then the target is mounted - right ?
[2024-01-13 05:05] <kotgc> Bashing-om I don't know? From commands here, that appears to be the case I think? https://dpaste.com/BHMDYCZCZ
[2024-01-13 05:05] <kotgc> This tells me to not chroot.
[2024-01-13 05:06] <kotgc> However, I am looking for a command to confirm /dev/sda2 is not mounted.
[2024-01-13 05:07] <Bashing-om> kotgc: 1. Boot from the Ubuntu Live CD; 2. Open/Run Terminal; 3. Type: sudo fdisk -l (to get the device name) then press ENTER; 4. Type: sudo fsck /dev/sda2 then press ENTER; 5. Restart the system and boot normally.
[2024-01-13 05:09] <kotgc> Bashing-om thx.
[2024-01-13 05:10] <kotgc> I'm unsure which disk to fsck?
[2024-01-13 05:10] <kotgc> https://dpaste.com/3RAZPKXZC
[2024-01-13 05:11] <kotgc> test
[2024-01-13 05:11] <kotgc> I'm unsure if /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 is the root system? I guess the root system needs fsck?
[2024-01-13 05:11] <kotgc> dpaste lines 73-75.
[2024-01-13 05:12] <Bashing-om> kotgc: Looking again.
[2024-01-13 05:17] <Bashing-om> kotgc: consider - sda1 is "EFI System" --- EFI is a "FAT" file system -- so that can not be your linux partition /// now  we see 2 options - sda2 OR sdb4 /// any idea what sdb4 is ?
[2024-01-13 05:19] <kotgc> That failed.
[2024-01-13 05:24] <Bashing-om> kotgc: "That failed." is not very helpful to know a cause.
[2024-01-13 05:24] <kotgc> Bashing-om well, black screen remains.
[2024-01-13 05:27] <Bashing-om> kotgc: well --- when you boot can you get to grub's boot menu ? we can here boot to a TTY on the install.
[2024-01-13 05:28] <kotgc> Bashing-om yes, I can access grub's boot menu.
[2024-01-13 05:31] <Bashing-om> kotgc: At the grub menu press 'e' to edit - Append: systemd.unit=multi-user.target to the linux line.
[2024-01-13 05:31] <kotgc> ok
[2024-01-13 05:32] <kotgcFromPhone> Test
[2024-01-13 05:32] <kotgc> At the grub menu press 'e' to edit - Append: systemd.unit=multi-user.target to the linux line.
[2024-01-13 05:32] <Bashing-om> kotgc: See the bottom of the screen - crl+x to comtinie the boot process.
[2024-01-13 05:34] <kotgcFromPhone> Done

[2024-01-13 05:58] <kotgcGuest59> Bashing-om what was the test and did it pass?
[2024-01-13 06:02] <Bashing-om> kotgcGuest59: The test was to see if you were able to activate the GUI . //  We now know however - that there is a config issue in starting the GUI.
[2024-01-13 06:02] <kotgcGuest59> Bashing-om ok
[2024-01-13 06:04] <Bashing-om> kotgcGuest59: Unfortunately - I have not run Gnome as my DE in years . I really do not know how Gnome starts the GUI.
[2024-01-13 06:05] <kotgcGuest59> Bashing-om thx, guess I'll search how Gnome starts the GUI.

[2024-01-13 08:43] <webchat39> Hi after one of last updates I experiencing suspend does not work
[2024-01-13 08:44] <webchat39> anybody else with the same experience these days?
[2024-01-13 10:43] <meator> Hi. When I do snap run musixmatch, nothing happens. I'm running Ubuntu in a VM. How can I get more verbose output?
[2024-01-13 10:52] <kotgcGuest59> Hello, is there a way to copy journalctl output from grub?
[2024-01-13 10:59] <kotgcGuest59> I can copy journalctl output from a LiveUSB, but I'm unsure that's the right information needed to show Ubuntu 22.04.3 booting to a black screen and not starting the Gnome GUI?
[2024-01-13 11:04] <jeremy31> kotgcGuest59:  you can pipe output from a command to a text file, like>     dmesg > dmesg.txt
[2024-01-13 11:05] <kotgcGuest59> jeremy31 can I retrieve this dmesg.txt file from LiveUSB afterwards?
[2024-01-13 11:05] <jeremy31> Only until you reboot
[2024-01-13 11:05] <kotgcGuest59> jeremy31 oh, I need to post the output somehow?
[2024-01-13 11:05] <jeremy31> Could put it on paste.ubuntu.com
[2024-01-13 11:06] <kotgcGuest59> I only have grub command control, as gnome won't start the GUI.
[2024-01-13 11:06] <kotgcGuest59> Maybe there's a command to do that?
[2024-01-13 11:06] <kotgcGuest59> nc|termbin or something?
[2024-01-13 11:06] <jeremy31> kotgcGuest59: which pastebinit
[2024-01-13 11:07] <jeremy31> kotgcGuest59:  command | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-13 11:07] <kotgcGuest59> ...actually, grub has no network, ping 1.1.1.1 fails.
[2024-01-13 11:07] <kotgcGuest59> Only this liveUSB is working for now.
[2024-01-13 11:07] <kotgcGuest59> I thought I might be able to retrieve the journalct.txt file from LiveUSB somehow.
[2024-01-13 11:08] <kotgcGuest59> Otherwise, I'll have to photograph it.
[2024-01-13 11:09] <jeremy31> kotgcGuest59: Check the USB, there may be a partition where you can save a text file
[2024-01-13 11:12] <kotgcGuest59> jeremy31 ok
[2024-01-13 12:35] <evan> yo
[2024-01-13 13:33] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-13 14:22] <spinningCat> i am asorry but ubuntu is retard
[2024-01-13 14:25] <McParen> go away?
[2024-01-13 14:29] <aruns> I've got the following drop-in for notify-send in ~/.bashrc in Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (WSL2), https://bpa.st/E6MA, but when I run notify-send "Test", I get the error message "Could not connect: No such file or directory". Any ideas as to how to get this working?
[2024-01-13 14:29] <aruns> I want to get notify-send to work with non-root users.
[2024-01-13 14:44] <tomreyn> arunsis X running as root there?
[2024-01-13 14:45] <tomreyn> i'm not really familar with WSL, but hopefully it isn't
[2024-01-13 14:46] <tomreyn> also, on a proper ubuntu installation, the values you write into local variables there are already set in their uppercase counterparts in the environment.
[2024-01-13 14:47] <tomreyn> and you may be missing the leading colon for DISPLAY
[2024-01-13 14:58] <aruns> Display is :0
[2024-01-13 14:58] <aruns> So it should be correct
[2024-01-13 14:59] <aruns> I'm running an X11 forwarding server on Windows via MobaXTerm
[2024-01-13 15:02] <ubuntu> hi
[2024-01-13 15:12] <BigMo> ola amigos
[2024-01-13 15:17] <magga> sometimes my bluetooth hangs on my machine: (https://dpaste.com/EH7N8JGGY) it just says its turned off. and i cant turn it off. ive tried through terminal and from gui in Ubuntu. anyone know a solution? i have to manually power my machine off and on again, to get it working
[2024-01-13 15:17] <magga> happens rarely. but enough to be annoying
[2024-01-13 15:27] <EriC^^> good evening all
[2024-01-13 16:04] <FKAShinobi_> I want to setup a VPN on my laptop using the gnome VPN UI. There is a field for gateway, what if I don't know the gateway while on a network?
[2024-01-13 16:06] <FKAShinobi_> Or is that the ip of the gateway the vpn client will become?
[2024-01-13 16:09] <ravage> gateway usually means the external IP of your VPN server
[2024-01-13 16:09] <FKAShinobi_> ok, not the LAN's default gateway... that makes more sense
[2024-01-13 16:09] <FKAShinobi_> Thanks
[2024-01-13 16:56] <spinningCat> i installed mssql-server it gave me hadhache
[2024-01-13 16:56] <spinningCat> this microsoft should go to hell
[2024-01-13 16:57] <rbox> spinningCat: okay?
[2024-01-13 16:57] <oerheks> what guide did you follow?
[2024-01-13 16:58] <spinningCat> official documentation
[2024-01-13 16:58] <spinningCat> and wubuntu is trash no
[2024-01-13 16:58] <spinningCat> w
[2024-01-13 16:58] <spinningCat> so windows shouldnt be part of linux world :D
[2024-01-13 16:59] <ravage> so no support question in sight here. moving on
[2024-01-13 16:59] <rjwiii> Ubuntu 22.04. Installed MusicPod via SNAP ... Click on the icon and nothing happens. I am able to start it via CLI ... Any ideas?
[2024-01-13 17:00] <ravage> Maybe the maintainer messed up the desktop fileÂ
[2024-01-13 17:00] <Slartibart> Is there a way to "debug" audio in Ubuntu? I put a stereo cable in L-out, and a stereo cable in CS-out to the subwoofer(So I guess I'm kind of aiming for 2.1 sound). However, no matter what I do(so far) there's no sound coming out of the subwoofer. If I move the cable from L-out to RS-out I do get sound when clicking on the subwoofer button in 'Test speakers' in Ubuntu settings. Long story short, I'm
[2024-01-13 17:00] <Slartibart> at a loss how to connect things to get 2.1 sound. 2.0/stereo worked just fine before this, and still does. But how to get the subwoofer going?
[2024-01-13 17:01] <oerheks> rjwiii, did you run  sudo snap connect musicpod:network-manager-observe >> https://snapcraft.io/musicpod
[2024-01-13 17:02] <ravage> it starts just fine here via the launcher without any additional permissions
[2024-01-13 17:04] <rjwiii> oerheks: I installed via Ubuntu software installer. There were no instructions to do that. When I run MusicPod via CLI, it finds my music collection and can find radio stations when I search.
[2024-01-13 17:06] <oerheks> i see sonme issues after a mesa update, unconclusive https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft.io/issues/4489
[2024-01-13 18:21] <dlfke> my network doesn't come up by default, how can i fix it?
[2024-01-13 18:26] <ioria> dlfke, what's the problem with it ?
[2024-01-13 18:26] <ioria> dlfke, it came up or you would not be here
[2024-01-13 18:27] <dlfke> another computer
[2024-01-13 18:27] <dlfke> adapter is just being down until I run dhclient for it
[2024-01-13 18:28] <dlfke> it is a freshly installed sustem
[2024-01-13 18:28] <ioria> dlfke, ok,  try to set a static ip
[2024-01-13 18:28] <ioria> dlfke, nm-connection-editor
[2024-01-13 18:28] <dlfke> what does ubuntu use to manage the networks anyway?
[2024-01-13 18:29] <ioria> dlfke, network-manager
[2024-01-13 18:29] <dlfke> that sucns
[2024-01-13 18:29] <ioria> sucns ?
[2024-01-13 18:30] <sem> you shouldn't have to run dhclient manually network-manager is supposed to take care of it
[2024-01-13 18:31] <sem> can you give more info, like ethernet or wifi, what kind of network, etc
[2024-01-13 18:33] <ioria> maybe an old install with still a /e/n/i set or ifupdown installed or worst
[2024-01-13 18:38] <dlfke> shouldn'tÂ  netplan create the files for networkd?
[2024-01-13 18:38] <dlfke> or why do I need netplan at alll then?
[2024-01-13 18:38] <ioria> dlfke, if you paste your *yamls file w can have a look
[2024-01-13 18:39] <ioria> *we
[2024-01-13 18:46] <dlfke> I think I'll nuke that canonical crap and setup networkd
[2024-01-13 18:47] <tomreyn> did you install ubuntu desktop, or server, or something else? which release?
[2024-01-13 18:48] <oerheks> different problem than in #linux
[2024-01-13 18:54] <dlfke> you can't reinstall snapd because "host hunspell" package is bugged and breaks the install script causing dpkg to fail
[2024-01-13 18:54] <dlfke> *uninstall
[2024-01-13 18:56] <ravage> i reinstalled snapd about 5 hours ago
[2024-01-13 19:05] <devslash> I am on ubuntu 23.10. when i boot it, it boots ubuntu but displays info about usb but never boots the desktop environment. if i press alt f3 i can log in through a alternste terminal
[2024-01-13 19:05] <devslash> does anyone know how to fix this ?
[2024-01-13 19:07] <tomreyn> devslash: what's this "info about usb" it displays? which graphics card do you have there?
[2024-01-13 19:08] <tomreyn> did this work previously on 23.10 or earlier releases (did you upgrade to 23.10?) or was it like this from the start?
[2024-01-13 19:08] <devslash> actually
[2024-01-13 19:09] <devslash> funny enough I was also googling it and came across a post on stack overflow that said to remove and reinstall gdm and that fixed the issue for me
[2024-01-13 19:18] <dlfke> ubuntu still installs gtk2 by default o_O
[2024-01-13 19:22] <oerheks> so?
[2024-01-13 19:26] <McParen> isnt backward compatibility a good thing?
[2024-01-13 19:28] <oerheks> some app must have pulled some parts in.
[2024-01-13 19:29] <oerheks> still only rants, and no real support question sofar
[2024-01-13 20:07] <Urk> what is Ubuntu's version of killall
[2024-01-13 20:09] <oerheks> killall
[2024-01-13 20:09] <oerheks> https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/killall.1.html
[2024-01-13 21:17] <zetheroo> I am having problems with Transmission causing my PC to freeze up. CPU and Memory are not maxing out - not even close. The single torrent will be downloading for a few minutes at ~15-20Mb/sec and then suddenly everything freezes up, the download/upload speed drops to zero, and Transmission has to be force quit to able to use the PC.
[2024-01-13 21:18] <tomreyn> is there anything in dmesg about it?
[2024-01-13 21:18] <zetheroo> The only resource which increases as the torrent is downloading is the buff/cache as shown by 'free -h'.
[2024-01-13 21:19] <sem> is your disk ok? any alerts in smart?
[2024-01-13 21:19] <pragmaticenigma> zetheroo, this is sounding like a disk full or disk failure type situation
[2024-01-13 21:19] <zetheroo> Disk (SSD) is not full.
[2024-01-13 21:19] <zetheroo> 38GB free
[2024-01-13 21:20] <zetheroo> tomreyn: I didn't think to check that.
[2024-01-13 21:21] <zetheroo> I'll run Transmission again and check
[2024-01-13 21:22] <tomreyn> zetheroo: you can do it now.    sudo journalctl -b     or    sudo dmesg -T     - or, to watch the logs while you're reproducing it:     sudo journalctl -f    or     sudo dmesg -w
[2024-01-13 21:22] <pragmaticenigma> zetheroo, In linux there are two ways a disk runs out of space, either physical or inodes. If you have a lot of files on the disk, it's possible to have plenty of physical space, but be disk full in terms of inodes. Torrent creates a lot of file fragments, and if you're at the upper limit of available inodes, the disk will appear full.
[2024-01-13 21:22] <pragmaticenigma> dmesg will hopefully clear that up
[2024-01-13 21:27] <zetheroo> hmm... nothing from dmesg
[2024-01-13 21:27] <zetheroo> last output from dmesg was over an hour ago
[2024-01-13 21:27] <zetheroo> and I just reproduced the problem and no new info
[2024-01-13 21:28] <pragmaticenigma> is transmission running as a snap or apt package install?
[2024-01-13 21:29] <zetheroo> journalctl shows more info though
[2024-01-13 21:29] <zetheroo> pragmaticenigma: actually not sure
[2024-01-13 21:31] <zetheroo> how can I tell?
[2024-01-13 21:31] <oerheks> if those persist, reset your router?
[2024-01-13 21:31] <zetheroo> oerheks: You think this could really be caused by my router?
[2024-01-13 21:31] <pragmaticenigma> no
[2024-01-13 21:32] <pragmaticenigma> computers don't freeze up because of a route
[2024-01-13 21:32] <pragmaticenigma> router
[2024-01-13 21:34] <oerheks> if it cannot handle manny connections somehow, i tend to check if it was my router
[2024-01-13 21:34] <zetheroo> this is what's journald while transmission is freezing up my PC: https://pastebin.com/gesCbDXr
[2024-01-13 21:34] <pragmaticenigma> zetheroo, if it is a snap it will show up when you use `snap list` in the terminal. Or `snap list | grep -i tr` might narrow down the list
[2024-01-13 21:35] <zetheroo> ok, it's not a snap then
[2024-01-13 21:36] <pragmaticenigma> are you trying to torrent using WiFi?
[2024-01-13 21:36] <zetheroo> Yes, I've done this for years on this laptop
[2024-01-13 21:36] <zetheroo> only in the recent last could weeks or so did this start to happen.
[2024-01-13 21:37] <zetheroo> Could it be my SSD on the fritz?
[2024-01-13 21:37] <natewrench> im having firefox randomly freeze
[2024-01-13 21:37] <natewrench> have to kill the process
[2024-01-13 21:37] <pragmaticenigma> zetheroo, unfortunately anything of use was clipped in the journal message. I suspect that is possible
[2024-01-13 21:37] <natewrench> i submitted a bug report
[2024-01-13 21:38] <pragmaticenigma> natewrench, there is no need to inform the channel that you have filed a bug report. this channel is not monitored by Canonical or Ubuntu developers
[2024-01-13 21:38] <natewrench> ok
[2024-01-13 21:38] <pragmaticenigma> (well developers might be here, but they're not monitoring for bug reports)
[2024-01-13 21:38] <natewrench> heads up
[2024-01-13 21:39] <natewrench> hopefully 24.04 lts will have a more stable firefox build
[2024-01-13 21:40] <tomreyn> zetheroo: sudo journalctl --since 'Jan 13 22:21:11' --until 'Jan 13 22:24:15' | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-13 21:40] <zetheroo> this is older output of dmesg ... maybe something with the disk? https://pastebin.com/XR6h1pjE
[2024-01-13 21:41] <zetheroo> tomreyn: returns "Failed to parse timestamp: Jan 13 22:21:11"
[2024-01-13 21:42] <tomreyn> zetheroo: you added an extra " character there
[2024-01-13 21:43] <pragmaticenigma> pretty sure the error message put that there. Think a YYYY prefix is needed on those date ranges
[2024-01-13 21:43] <tomreyn> not on my system
[2024-01-13 21:43] <zetheroo> tomreyn: where?
[2024-01-13 21:43] <pragmaticenigma> or there system is not in the same time zone as you, and thus those hours have not transpired yet
[2024-01-13 21:43] <tomreyn> zetheroo: somewhere between   --since     and  --until
[2024-01-13 21:44] <pragmaticenigma> their*
[2024-01-13 21:44] <tomreyn> i took these timestamps from https://pastebin.com/raw/gesCbDXr
[2024-01-13 21:44] <zetheroo> tomreyn: I copy/pasted what you posted here
[2024-01-13 21:45] <tomreyn> zetheroo: okay, ignore it. your later log shows there's a different, underlying, issue, anyways
[2024-01-13 21:45] <zetheroo> Ok
[2024-01-13 21:46] <zetheroo> Something wrong with my disk?
[2024-01-13 21:47] <tomreyn> zetheroo: if you look at https://pastebin.com/raw/XR6h1pjE you see there are hung tasks, the first one listed is related to ext4 file system journalling. this can be just a result of low disk performance, but should not normally happen. it can be a side effect of other issues. i'd try to look through logs and find the first "INFO:" record
[2024-01-13 21:47] <oerheks> kworker does something too
[2024-01-13 21:48] <tomreyn> do we know which ubuntu release this is, and whether the software is fully up to date?
[2024-01-13 21:48] <pragmaticenigma> nope
[2024-01-13 21:48] <oerheks> 5.15.0-91...
[2024-01-13 21:49] <zetheroo> tomreyn: the first "INFO" record since boot?
[2024-01-13 21:49] <tomreyn> zetheroo: yes. can you also answer the questions i just brought up, please?
[2024-01-13 21:49] <tomreyn> (no rush)
[2024-01-13 21:50] <zetheroo> Ubuntu 22.04 5.15.0-91-generic
[2024-01-13 21:50] <zetheroo> Yes, full updated
[2024-01-13 21:51] <tomreyn> https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/linux-image-generic says https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/linux-image-5.15.0-91-generic is current indeed
[2024-01-13 21:54] <oerheks> i would add HWE to that LTS
[2024-01-13 21:55] <oerheks> but that might not be the issue with transmission, clean the cache and try adding torrent again?
[2024-01-13 21:56] <zetheroo> I'm still trying to find the "INFO" record in the logs ...
[2024-01-13 21:56] <tomreyn> you type    sudo journalctl -b   then press / and type INFO: and press enter
[2024-01-13 21:56] <zetheroo> Oh thanks :D
[2024-01-13 21:57] <Firefly10> I been using Linux mint for a year and then switch to Ubuntu LTS to try, ran it about 10 days before I had an issue that made it unusable, I searched forum and tried what I could there, but non of it solved issue. Figured I try here before giving up.    so one day my display resolution changed to 360x480 real hard to work with and can not change
[2024-01-13 21:57] <Firefly10> it, says "display unknown" also noticed the wifi was dongle was not visible.    I did not see any way to reinstall without losing my data, only thing I was able to do is do an install to new partition to boot to, which worked, so my hardware is fine but some how my first Ubuntu broke.
[2024-01-13 21:57] <zetheroo> OK, first "INFO" hist are related to cron
[2024-01-13 21:57] <tomreyn> zetheroo: this text viewer software is 'less', and this is how you search in 'less'
[2024-01-13 21:57] <zetheroo> I guess those are not of interest
[2024-01-13 21:58] <tomreyn> zetheroo: does it say "state:D" and "blocked for..." as well?
[2024-01-13 21:58] <zetheroo> next hit is: whoopsie-upload-all[1837]: INFO:root:/var/crash/_usr_bin_transmission-gtk.1000.crash already marked for upload, skipping
[2024-01-13 22:00] <zetheroo> tomreyn: this is the very first 'INFO' record: cron[1796]: (CRON) INFO (pidfile fd = 3)
[2024-01-13 22:00] <zetheroo> second one: cron[1796]: (CRON) INFO (Running @reboot jobs)
[2024-01-13 22:01] <tomreyn> okay, that's not "INFO:" though
[2024-01-13 22:02] <zetheroo> third one: whoopsie-upload-all[1837]: INFO:root:/var/crash/_usr_bin_transmission-gtk.1000.crash already marked for upload, skipping
[2024-01-13 22:02] <tomreyn> if you expect to be able to reproduce the issue after a fresh reboot, it'll be best to do that and then share the full kernel log.
[2024-01-13 22:02] <zetheroo> OK, will do that.
[2024-01-13 22:02] <zetheroo> bbs
[2024-01-13 22:20] <Firefly10> I am rebuilding my ubuntu computer , is it a good idea to move the home folder to a separate partition? any tips?
[2024-01-13 22:21] <tomreyn> it can be good to have it on a separate file system, because this can make it easy to reinstall the OS without having to copy around the data from /home (you'd just keep this partition where it is). that's not a reason not to have backups, though.
[2024-01-13 22:23] <zetheroo> I'm back, but with slightly bad news - the torrent has been active now for over 10 minutes without the system freezing up.
[2024-01-13 22:23] <Firefly10> that is what I ran into, I somehow broke ubuntu and can't fix it, and moving files are a pain
[2024-01-13 22:24] <zetheroo> It's not downloading as fast as it was before (15-20Mb/s before, and now ~5-10Mb/s).
[2024-01-13 22:24] <zetheroo> I don't know why :/
[2024-01-13 22:26] <zetheroo> The only thing I change between reboots was that before I was on battery and after I was plugged into power.
[2024-01-13 22:28] <zetheroo> For interest sake - here is my boot log till now https://termbin.com/ihle
[2024-01-13 22:29] <zetheroo> Maybe there's something useful in there
[2024-01-13 22:41] <Firefly10> I can't resize my data partition, it has free space before it, but not after
[2024-01-13 22:43] <Firefly10> anyway to move the leading edge of partition?
[2024-01-13 22:43] <rbox> gparted
[2024-01-13 22:45] <Firefly10> oh wow, yes forgot gparted was there
[2024-01-13 22:45] <Firefly10> works!
[2024-01-13 22:45] <Firefly10> thank you!
[2024-01-13 23:22] <tomreyn> zetheroo: there's not much to be seen on your kernel log, nothing too unusual. i'd say if it happens again, share another. and keep note of whether it coul dbe related to suspend / resume.
[2024-01-13 23:24] <oerheks> got a transmission update just now

[2024-01-14 01:12] <telgareith> wait, are not all yy.04 releases LTS?
[2024-01-14 01:12] <telgareith> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history
[2024-01-14 01:13] <rbox> every 2 years
[2024-01-14 01:13] <telgareith> that's dumb
[2024-01-14 01:14] <telgareith> I would expect something else for non LTS releases, or change LTS release indication.
[2024-01-14 01:14] <mybalzitch> cool, you're welcome to contribute for a while, get on the board, then come up with a coherent argument about why LTS releases should be more or less frequent
[2024-01-14 01:15] <rbox> telgareith: what do you mean "change LTS release indication"
[2024-01-14 01:18] <telgareith> I've always assumed xx.04 meant a LTS release
[2024-01-14 01:19] <telgareith> microsoft does it like "22H1 LTSB"
[2024-01-14 01:19] <rbox> just because you assumed something doesnt make it so
[2024-01-14 01:19] <rbox> it doesnt matter what microsoft does
[2024-01-14 01:20] <mybalzitch> I mean, LTS is in the release name
[2024-01-14 01:20] <mybalzitch> 20.04 LTS, that's LTS. 22.04 LTS, that's also LTS
[2024-01-14 01:20] <mybalzitch> 23.10 ... that's not LTS
[2024-01-14 01:21] <oerheks> next one is .. get used to it
[2024-01-14 01:39] <telgareith> ahh, linux people. same level of Caring about usability as ever.
[2024-01-14 01:43] <oerheks> telgareith, this is ubuntu support, drop that attitude.
[2024-01-14 02:57] <xxy> my Ubuntu $PATH be changed like this " $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH:/snap/bin", so mostly command can't execute, how to restore it
[2024-01-14 02:59] <rbox> xxy: what?
[2024-01-14 03:00] <antonchigur> echo $PATH
[2024-01-14 03:00] <antonchigur> and send output in this chat
[2024-01-14 03:01] <xxy> antonchigur, the result of echo "$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH:/snap/bin
[2024-01-14 03:01] <xxy> "
[2024-01-14 03:01] <antonchigur> xxy: you are forget add /bin and /usr/bin
[2024-01-14 03:02] <antonchigur> $PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH:/snap/bin
[2024-01-14 03:02] <antonchigur> xxy: try to change to it
[2024-01-14 03:03] <xxy> antonchigur, i don't know how to change it , the command like "vim" "sudo" can't work well now
[2024-01-14 03:03] <antonchigur> what bash are you use? zsh or bash?
[2024-01-14 03:04] <xxy> antonchigur, bash
[2024-01-14 03:04] <antonchigur> echo "$PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/snap/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
[2024-01-14 03:04] <antonchigur> try something like this
[2024-01-14 03:10] <xxy> antonchigur,  i can't switch into root , after executing you command ,the $PATH have no change
[2024-01-14 03:10] <antonchigur> you are execute that command under user account?
[2024-01-14 03:11] <antonchigur> if its right, you are need type next command
[2024-01-14 03:11] <antonchigur> . ~/.bashrc
[2024-01-14 03:11] <antonchigur> this command will reload your bash environment
[2024-01-14 03:14] <xxy> antonchigur, https://paste.centos.org/view/857bafad
[2024-01-14 03:15] <xxy> antonchigur, by the way , the ubuntu system is provided by VPS vendor,
[2024-01-14 03:15] <arraybolt3> oof, VPS vendors are known for applying weird customizations to their Ubuntu images
[2024-01-14 03:16] <antonchigur> its right
[2024-01-14 03:16] <antonchigur> xxy: try to log out and log in in your VPS
[2024-01-14 03:17] <xxy> antonchigur, ok , if it not work yet, then i re-install OS
[2024-01-14 03:17] <antonchigur> ok, good luck xxy
[2024-01-14 04:19] <jwash> Hi everyone. So that I can lookup tutorials, what is the concept called to make a second network on an Ubuntu computer (2nd nic) so that i can transfer files with another computer on that secondary network, but still retain internet connectivity via the primary network?
[2024-01-14 04:19] <jwash> like a pure file transfer network
[2024-01-14 04:21] <jwash> like internet network is 192.168.x.x and file transfer is 10.10.x.x
[2024-01-14 04:25] <ravage> jwash: set static IPs in that network. Do not use any gateway. That's it.
[2024-01-14 04:31] <jwash> ravage: direct connection, or can i use a switch?
[2024-01-14 04:34] <rbox> siwthc doesnt effect anything
[2024-01-14 04:35] <jwash> https://imgur.com/7NgFc5p.png
[2024-01-14 04:35] <jwash> can i do the top configuration
[2024-01-14 04:35] <jwash> by adding a second nic to each computer?
[2024-01-14 04:36] <jwash> the device at 192.168.0.1 is a router/switch
[2024-01-14 04:36] <rbox> you can try it
[2024-01-14 04:36] <rbox> not gonna make your computer blow up
[2024-01-14 04:37] <jwash> lol true
[2024-01-14 05:42] <italicizem> What's a good way to keep 22.04 pretty fresh? Backports a good idea? Mostly thinking about desktop apps but maybe also things like sound libraries etc.

[2024-01-14 08:54] <en1gma> does ubuntu touch (android devices) have an irc channel? i cant seem to find it
[2024-01-14 10:00] <Whiskey`> what package provides the 'additional drivers' app?
[2024-01-14 10:00] <lotuspsychje> Whiskey`: software&sources
[2024-01-14 10:01] <lotuspsychje> Whiskey`: you can also check from commandline, ubuntu-drivers list
[2024-01-14 10:04] <ravage> the package ubuntu-drivers-common provides ubuntu-drivers . the gui part is in the package software-properties-gtk
[2024-01-14 10:05] <Whiskey`> software-properties-gtk is what was missing, thank you.
[2024-01-14 10:05] <lotuspsychje> cookie is for you ravage :p
[2024-01-14 10:06] <lotuspsychje> Whiskey`: you found a bug, or?
[2024-01-14 10:06] <Whiskey`> for sure a 'or'
[2024-01-14 10:06] <ravage> ðª nom nom
[2024-01-14 10:07] <lotuspsychje> Whiskey`: sorry?
[2024-01-14 10:07] <Whiskey`> no at all lotuspsychje
[2024-01-14 10:07] <Whiskey`> i went for a tiny install and then the plan pivioted and i needed a gui so a lot of packages didnt install with ubuntu-desktop
[2024-01-14 10:08] <lotuspsychje> ah i see
[2024-01-14 10:08] <Whiskey`> and it just keeps going sideways
[2024-01-14 10:09] <Whiskey`> if the wife wouldnt murder me for raiding the bank i would just buy a absolutely unreasonable system and be done with this
[2024-01-14 10:09] <lotuspsychje> lets keep things ontopic Whiskey`
[2024-01-14 10:11] <Whiskey`> ah right
[2024-01-14 10:11] <Whiskey`> whats the diff from nvidia-x-driver and nvidia-x-server
[2024-01-14 10:11] <lotuspsychje> server drivers are for ubuntu server
[2024-01-14 10:11] <Whiskey`> ....
[2024-01-14 10:12] <Whiskey`> isnt the only difference there, a gui/desktop?
[2024-01-14 10:13] <lotuspsychje> Whiskey`: can this help? https://askubuntu.com/questions/1262401/what-is-the-nvidia-server-driver
[2024-01-14 10:14] <Whiskey`> likely will, reading.
[2024-01-14 10:16] <Whiskey`> ok so more or less the difference is support timeline
[2024-01-14 10:16] <Whiskey`> aaand wth. 'cant update while offline. the box is very much online.
[2024-01-14 10:29] <Whiskey`> eh. "pk-client-error-quark cannot download whilst offline" has one solution on the forum and its nonsense. "disable networkmanager"

[2024-01-14 11:17] <leo__> hello
[2024-01-14 11:17] <leo__> any body here
[2024-01-14 11:17] <kevr> no.
[2024-01-14 11:17] <leo__> I am totally new to this
[2024-01-14 11:17] <kevr> leo__: I am joking. What's up?
[2024-01-14 11:17] <leo__> can u tell me where i am at?
[2024-01-14 11:18] <leo__> hahah i am fine thanks XD
[2024-01-14 11:18] <leo__> i dont even kow how this got installed lol
[2024-01-14 11:18] <kevr> what
[2024-01-14 11:18] <leo__> this chatting app
[2024-01-14 11:18] <kevr> you must have started up a program which connected to this channel
[2024-01-14 11:18] <leo__> hex chat
[2024-01-14 11:18] <kevr> okay, so, hexchat
[2024-01-14 11:18] <leo__> yessss
[2024-01-14 11:18] <kevr> you started up hexchat and connected here
[2024-01-14 11:19] <leo__> i dont recall installing it though hahah
[2024-01-14 11:19] <kevr> it probably was installed by the default packages, because you likely did not choose a minimal install, it comes as part of common software one may wish to use
[2024-01-14 11:19] <leo__> i was installing a Cinnamon desktop env on my Ubuntu
[2024-01-14 11:19] <leo__> and maybe it came through that as a result?
[2024-01-14 11:19] <leo__> i also got chess or something
[2024-01-14 11:19] <kevr> are you sure that this wasn't on your system **before** installing Cinnamon?
[2024-01-14 11:20] <leo__> yess i think so seems weird..
[2024-01-14 11:20] <leo__> maybe i noticed it today
[2024-01-14 11:20] <kevr> you think so, do you know?
[2024-01-14 11:21] <leo__> ithink it came through installing cinammon
[2024-01-14 11:21] <kevr> if it was a dependency, then uninstalling hexchat should complain about the other programs being affected. you could look through there, or through your apt log to see at which point hexchat was installed
[2024-01-14 11:21] <leo__> cuz i saw some pigieon there
[2024-01-14 11:21] <kevr> that's also a chat application
[2024-01-14 11:21] <leo__> btw we r in an app like discord
[2024-01-14 11:21] <leo__> or this is some forum thing?
[2024-01-14 11:21] <kevr> may i ask
[2024-01-14 11:21] <kevr> how did you become connected to this channel? did you launch hexchat and it just automatically connected here?
[2024-01-14 11:21] <leo__> yesss yesss u can ask lol
[2024-01-14 11:21] <kevr> or did you connect?
[2024-01-14 11:22] <leo__> i opened hex chat and i pressed ok and ok so yea
[2024-01-14 11:22] <leo__> i connected
[2024-01-14 11:22] <kevr> you pressed ok to what?
[2024-01-14 11:22] <kevr> ok, and ok*
[2024-01-14 11:22] <leo__> it automtaically filled in my linux pc name "leo"
[2024-01-14 11:22] <leo__> to username places
[2024-01-14 11:23] <leo__> and i was like yea press ok
[2024-01-14 11:23] <leo__> is this a sockets program or something?
[2024-01-14 11:23] <leo__> a big group chat?
[2024-01-14 11:23] <kevr> this is a general community support channel on IRC, the Internet Relay Chat protocol, which is hosted by Libera.chat in this case. This is a chatroom, yes. Whatever you installed or setup may just had connecting here as a default for users or something.
[2024-01-14 11:23] <leo__> yess slol
[2024-01-14 11:24] <leo__> but i never though communities like this exist today lol
[2024-01-14 11:24] <leo__> m feeling like m in 90s
[2024-01-14 11:24] <leo__> lmao
[2024-01-14 11:24] <kevr> This channel is specifically here for conversation about getting something to work, or fixed, on the Ubuntu linux distribution. However, normally, users are expected to at least try to resolve it themselves through available documentation before asking in here about it.
[2024-01-14 11:24] <kevr> also, every single community that exists today in chat rooms still uses this same idea; the only difference is how it is presented to you, really, as a user
[2024-01-14 11:24] <leo__> oh so its a helping community
[2024-01-14 11:25] <kevr> discord, slack, whatever, they all have text going over the network
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> yesssss
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> but they are overwhelmed with
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> emojis pics videos
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> ths really gives 90s feeling
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> i mean in a good way
[2024-01-14 11:25] <kevr> that's because of how their frontend decides to display stuff to the user
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> yessss i know lmao
[2024-01-14 11:25] <kevr> you could take Discord data and present it in such a way that it looks exactly like this, if you wanted to
[2024-01-14 11:25] <leo__> yesssss
[2024-01-14 11:26] <leo__> can we send friend requests or something?
[2024-01-14 11:26] <kevr> and yes, IRC was one of the more well-known original chat protocols on the net, and it remains reminiscent of its original style in most clients.
[2024-01-14 11:27] <leo__> btw i yesterday thought
[2024-01-14 11:27] <leo__> about leraning sockets
[2024-01-14 11:27] <kevr> No. However, one part of etiquette in these chatrooms are staying on topic -- that is, this channel is for Ubuntu conversation, and so technically talking about IRC and what it is, is not completely on-topic here. There is much information around the internet you could use to learn about IRC; the information is plenty.
[2024-01-14 11:27] <leo__> specificallysockets in Java
[2024-01-14 11:27] <leo__> to build a simple chat group
[2024-01-14 11:28] <leo__> over my own network
[2024-01-14 11:28] <leo__> just for learning and fun
[2024-01-14 11:28] <kevr> why not, go ahead
[2024-01-14 11:29] <kevr> leo__: #ubuntu-offtopic seems to be a more suitable chatroom for this kind of talk, which is really just social conversation
[2024-01-14 11:30] <leo__> oh sorry for that i really am haha Howcan i join that?
[2024-01-14 11:30] <leo__> me so dumb and it feels like i am using internet for first time which i am not haha
[2024-01-14 11:30] <kevr> You can type /join #ubuntu-offtopic in your IRC Client (hexchat).
[2024-01-14 11:30] <kevr> leo__: welcome to IRC
[2024-01-14 11:31] <leo__> Thank u so much for the welcome and helping mate..U R the first person ever i have talked to here In IRC......!!
[2024-01-14 11:32] <kevr> No problem at all. I hope you can find some nice community and use through IRC :)
[2024-01-14 11:32] <eqw> Hello. Why there's no /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/block/loop.ko ?
[2024-01-14 11:32] <leo__> haha thanks kevr
[2024-01-14 11:33] <tomreyn> eqw: there should be. which ubuntu release are you on, which linux-image-*  packages are installed?
[2024-01-14 11:34] <eqw> 5.15.0-71-generic or 4.4.0-134-generic neither have it
[2024-01-14 11:35] <tomreyn> eqw: which ubuntu release are you on?
[2024-01-14 11:36] <tomreyn> lsb_release -ds    should tell
[2024-01-14 11:36] <tomreyn> or    cat /etc/os-release
[2024-01-14 11:36] <eqw> 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
[2024-01-14 11:37] <eqw>   `apt-file search loop.ko|grep /loop.ko` shows it only in linux-modules-5.15.0-*-kvm
[2024-01-14 11:38] <tomreyn> first of all you should install all the pending updates
[2024-01-14 11:38] <tomreyn> 4.4.0 is an outdated kernel image from a previous ubutnu release, jammy doesn't have this
[2024-01-14 11:39] <tomreyn> 5.15.0-71-generic probably was in jammy at some point, but it's been a while
[2024-01-14 11:39] <tomreyn> amd64 is at linux-image-5.15.0-91-generic
[2024-01-14 11:39] <eqw> yes, 4.4.0 is another system, and it doesn't have loop.ko too which doesn't seem a mere coincidence
[2024-01-14 11:42] <eqw> http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-signed/linux-image-5.15.0-91-generic_5.15.0-91.101_amd64.deb doesn't contain /lib anyway
[2024-01-14 11:42] <tomreyn> i think it would be in linux-modules-5.15.0-91-generic or linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-91-generic
[2024-01-14 11:44] <eqw> http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-modules-5.15.0-91-generic_5.15.0-91.101_amd64.deb has /lib but doesn't contain loop.ko
[2024-01-14 11:45] <eqw> same applies to http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/linux-modules-extra-5.15.0-91-generic_5.15.0-91.101_amd64.deb
[2024-01-14 11:45] <jeremy31> eqw: try> modinfo loop
[2024-01-14 11:46] <eqw> filename:       (builtin)
[2024-01-14 11:46] <eqw> i wonder why i'm getting "failed to set up loop device: No such device or address" then
[2024-01-14 11:49] <tomreyn> maybe it'll be better to start from the beginning, and tell us what you're trying to do and why, which commands you ran, why your system is not updated?
[2024-01-14 11:52] <eqw> i'm trying to `mknod /dev/loop51 b 7 51 ; losetup /dev/loop51 /path/to/file`. My system is not updated because updates can break something.
[2024-01-14 11:56] <tomreyn> i'm looking at the losetup man page, which seems to suggest that losetup only accepts a single non option argument
[2024-01-14 11:57] <eqw> losetup [-o offset] [--sizelimit size] [--sector-size size] [-Pr] [--show] -f loopdev file
[2024-01-14 11:58] <tomreyn> right. maybe   losetup -f /dev/loop51 /path/to/file   is what you want?
[2024-01-14 12:00] <eqw> "losetup: unexpected arguments" which seems strange
[2024-01-14 12:01] <eqw> seems they changed the behaviour of losetup and didn't describe the change properly
[2024-01-14 12:02] <tomreyn> --help say that what you tried to do should work
[2024-01-14 12:04] <eqw> it worked in xenial
[2024-01-14 12:05] <tomreyn> does /dev/loop51 actually exist after the mknod command?
[2024-01-14 12:05] <tomreyn> do you run this as root?
[2024-01-14 12:06] <tomreyn> does it have proper user / group ownerships + permissions?
[2024-01-14 12:07] <eqw> yes it does exist. Yes I run it as root.
[2024-01-14 12:08] <tomreyn> i guess the issue is somehow related to your /path/to/file or outdated system then. i just tried this on an up to date amd64 jammy VM and it worked.
[2024-01-14 12:11] <tomreyn> this is what i ran: sudo mknod /dev/loop51 b 7 51 && sudo losetup /dev/loop51 /usr/share/doc/bash/README.gz
[2024-01-14 12:11] <tomreyn> I got a warning:    losetup: /usr/share/doc/bash/README.gz: Warning: file does not fit into a 512-byte sector; the end of the file will be ignored.
[2024-01-14 12:12] <tomreyn> but the command succeeded nevertheless
[2024-01-14 12:13] <eqw> my file is 10G so it's bigger than README.gz. That should not matter though
[2024-01-14 12:13] <eqw> and it's readable, i've opened its beginning with hexedit
[2024-01-14 12:32] <kotgcGuest59> Hello, anyone know how to fix an Ubuntu 22.04.3 black screen at boot?
[2024-01-14 12:32] <lotuspsychje> !nomodeset | kotgcGuest59 you can try this
[2024-01-14 12:32] <ubottu> kotgcGuest59 you can try this: Systems with certain graphics chipsets may not boot properly out of the box. "Temporarily Add a Kernel Boot Parameter for Testing" as discussed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters to add the "nomodeset" parameter there.
[2024-01-14 12:33] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: after reaching to desktop, you will need to find the rootcause of your black screen
[2024-01-14 12:33] <kotgcGuest59> ubottu thx, I've tried nomodeset, same issue. Hardware worked fine until I swapped a storage disk.
[2024-01-14 12:34] <kotgcGuest59> lotuspsychje how do I find the root cause of the black screen?
[2024-01-14 12:34] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: a good starting point would be sharing logs with the volunteers here, like dmesg or journal logs
[2024-01-14 12:36] <kotgcGuest59> lotuspsychje here's the journal logs, but from LiveUSB, as I only have grub access at boot. https://dpaste.com/HWJDNDFK9
[2024-01-14 12:36] <kotgcGuest59> Boot log https://dpaste.com/EUB9D8LS3
[2024-01-14 12:36] <kotgcGuest59> Casper log https://dpaste.com/89E34CCJ4
[2024-01-14 12:37] <kotgcGuest59> Kern log https://dpaste.com/GNRPHAGNH
[2024-01-14 12:37] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: those are just small parts of your logs, a full dmesg would be good
[2024-01-14 12:37] <kotgcGuest59> sys log https://dpaste.com/G8UQ5Y725
[2024-01-14 12:38] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: im seeing nouveau lines in there, are you booting to wayland or xorg?
[2024-01-14 12:38] <kotgcGuest59> xorg log https://dpaste.com/BC9YYPH6T
[2024-01-14 12:39] <kotgcGuest59> I can't get the full dmesg as the boot fails after 3 lines and goes to black screen.
[2024-01-14 12:39] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: you didnt update to kernel 6.5 recently?
[2024-01-14 12:40] <kotgcGuest59> I don't know what Wayland is? Weyland Industries - "building a better future"?
[2024-01-14 12:41] <kotgcGuest59> lotuspsychje Ubuntu 22.04.3 was on the latest update.
[2024-01-14 12:41] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: at login, the user can choose between xorg or wayland, default your desktop wants to pick wayland
[2024-01-14 12:41] <kotgcGuest59> lotuspsychje ok, whatever the Ubuntu 22.04.3 default is.
[2024-01-14 12:41] <lotuspsychje> and nvidia doesnt like wayland
[2024-01-14 12:43] <kotgcGuest59> Ok, however Ubuntu was fine until I changed a storage disk 3 to a LinuxMint OS. SSD3 booted LM nicely, passing a test after an electrical storm on 25th December 2023. However replacing the SSD3 with the original storage disk, the black screen issue appeared.
[2024-01-14 12:43] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: we can only support ubuntu and its flavours here, no mint
[2024-01-14 12:43] <kotgcGuest59> lotuspsychje sure, I'm not asking for LM support. This is an Ubuntu issue.
[2024-01-14 12:44] <lotuspsychje> ok
[2024-01-14 12:44] <kotgcGuest59> The description of the cause of the issue is why LM is mentioned.
[2024-01-14 12:44] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: see if you can reach into grub/recoverymode and fix broken packages from there (make sure your system is uptodate) and get in your desktop with failsafe graphics
[2024-01-14 12:45] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: after that, logout to gdm and pick Xorg to boot in
[2024-01-14 12:45] <lotuspsychje> and doublecheck with graphics drivers are loaded, nouveau vs nvidia
[2024-01-14 12:45] <kotgcGuest59> lotuspsychje wow, that sounds like a plan but is beyone my noob skills.
[2024-01-14 12:45] <lotuspsychje> kotgcGuest59: enter grub is easy
[2024-01-14 12:45] <kotgcGuest59> Yes, I can manage grub.
[2024-01-14 12:46] <kotgcGuest59> ...the following steps look tricky.
[2024-01-14 12:46] <lotuspsychje> from grub, you can get into recoverymode, enable networking and drop to a rootshell
[2024-01-14 12:46] <lotuspsychje> do your updates from there
[2024-01-14 12:46] <lotuspsychje> or other tasks the volunteers here can help you with
[2024-01-14 12:46] <kotgcGuest59> oh, there's no network in grub, as Ubuntu runs a network from a KVM. Curiously, the LiveUSB has network.
[2024-01-14 12:47] <kotgcGuest59> I can run updates from LiveUSB in chroot.
[2024-01-14 13:12] <DiogoConstantino> hi all!
[2024-01-14 13:15] <SteelRose> Hi DiogoConstantino

[2024-01-14 13:32] <lotuspsychje> stop that Guest39
[2024-01-14 13:33] <Guest39> oh there is people here
[2024-01-14 13:33] <Guest39> im sorry
[2024-01-14 13:33] <Guest39> hey buddy
[2024-01-14 13:34] <lotuspsychje> Guest39: this channel is for ubuntu support issues only
[2024-01-14 13:34] <Guest39> i use arch btw
[2024-01-14 13:35] <Guest39> bye. the nurse is giving me a bath
[2024-01-14 14:04] <zetheroo> tomreyn: it's happening again, and there's nothing interesting from dmesg or journal.
[2024-01-14 14:06] <zetheroo> oerheks: no updates available here for Transmission.
[2024-01-14 14:07] <zetheroo> What this "feels" like is that the WiFi driver (?) is crashing/stalling. It only happens when there is a high amount of data transfer in/out of ~20MB/s or more.
[2024-01-14 14:08] <anshparmar> ansh1234
[2024-01-14 14:08] <anshparmar> sudo apt install wine-development
[2024-01-14 14:09] <anshparmar> {
[2024-01-14 14:09] <zetheroo> I say this because in System Monitor I can see CPU and RAM continuing on stable, while the Network traffic nosedives and stays at zero until the system unfreezes.
[2024-01-14 14:18] <zetheroo> Also, around the time of freezing up I see this from journalctl: wpa_supplicant[1757]: wlp3s0: WPA: Group rekeying completed with 1c:ed:6f:c7:10:60 [GTK=CCMP]
[2024-01-14 14:18] <zetheroo> As if the WiFi is re-authenticating

[2024-01-14 14:35] <zetheroo> jeremy31: Ah I see - 2 disables power-saving
[2024-01-14 14:37] <zetheroo> OK, I've also restarted NetworkManager. I'll try some stuff again and see how it goes.
[2024-01-14 14:48] <zetheroo> Wifi just "crashed" again.
[2024-01-14 14:55] <zetheroo> This is what it looks like in the System Monitor https://ibb.co/c6NyDpY
[2024-01-14 14:56] <zetheroo> and here it is happening multiple times https://ibb.co/NCkR6b1
[2024-01-14 14:56] <zetheroo> If I limit the download speed in Transmission to ~15MB/s the freezes don't happen.
[2024-01-14 15:00] <zetheroo> hmm ... scratch that. here is it happening with 15MB/s https://ibb.co/KsXBfkh
[2024-01-14 15:00] <zetheroo> But for some reason I don't actually feel the system freezing up
[2024-01-14 15:01] <zetheroo> This is with Transmission creating the network traffic. I'm going to try with just copying data to/from my NAS over Files.
[2024-01-14 15:14] <zetheroo> I see this repeatedly in my system logs: wpa_supplicant[1757]: wlp3s0: WPA: Group rekeying completed with 1c:ed:6f:c7:10:60 [GTK=CCMP]
[2024-01-14 15:35] <jeremy31> zetheroo1: Something similar in my logs, every 10 minutes, likely normal.  Might be IP lease
[2024-01-14 15:36] <zetheroo1> ok, and what about this? https://pastebin.com/9HYsfWxQ
[2024-01-14 15:41] <zetheroo1> I wonder if the WiFi connection would be more stable using 2.4Ghz vs 5Ghz
[2024-01-14 15:44] <jeremy31> zetheroo1: URL for> grep [[:alnum:]] /sys/module/iwlwifi/parameters/* | nc termbin.com 9999

[2024-01-14 15:49] <jeremy31> zetheroo1: Might be as good as it gets
[2024-01-14 15:54] <tomreyn> zetheroo1: which transmission version do you have there? apt list transmission
[2024-01-14 16:06] <zetheroo1> tomreyn: transmission/jammy-updates,jammy-updates 3.00-2ubuntu2.1 all
[2024-01-14 16:10] <tomreyn> zetheroo1: okay, this seems ot be the latest for jammy
[2024-01-14 16:12] <tomreyn> zetheroo1: my guess is on some form of resource starvation, maybesome IRQ related issue, but those are difficult to diagnose (or maybe i just don't know enough about it). had you tried a bios upgrade?
[2024-01-14 16:13] <tomreyn> also try the hwe kernel
[2024-01-14 16:14] <zetheroo1> I haven't done a bios upgrade in a while.
[2024-01-14 16:14] <tomreyn> you have JBET73WW (1.37 ) 08/14/2019
[2024-01-14 16:16] <tomreyn> thats the latest available
[2024-01-14 16:16] <zetheroo1> seems that's the latest version :)
[2024-01-14 16:16] <zetheroo1> How about this HWE kernel. Is that something I need to add another repo for?
[2024-01-14 16:18] <tomreyn> no, you only need to sudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-20.04
[2024-01-14 16:18] <tomreyn> or was it 22.04?
[2024-01-14 16:18] <tomreyn> depending on what you are running
[2024-01-14 16:18] <zetheroo1> I have 22.04
[2024-01-14 16:18] <zetheroo1> ok
[2024-01-14 16:18] <tomreyn> sudo apt install linux-generic-hwe-22.04    then
[2024-01-14 16:21] <zetheroo1> ok, it's installed. Going to reboot now.
[2024-01-14 16:33] <zetheroo> Ok, back after reboot. Going to run some more tests with the HWE kernel.
[2024-01-14 16:39] <tomreyn> zetheroo: did you verify you're running the newer kernel version now?
[2024-01-14 16:41] <zetheroo> yes
[2024-01-14 16:41] <zetheroo> Linux eb-T420 6.5.0-14-generic #14~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Nov 20 18:15:30 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[2024-01-14 16:42] <oerheks> and latest transmission update? transmission_3.00-2ubuntu2.1
[2024-01-14 16:42] <tomreyn> <zetheroo1> tomreyn: transmission/jammy-updates,jammy-updates 3.00-2ubuntu2.1 all
[2024-01-14 16:43] <oerheks> oke, just checking after last night.
[2024-01-14 16:43] <tomreyn> hmm, actually it did not say it was installed
[2024-01-14 16:43] <tomreyn> zetheroo: what does this say?    apt list --installed transmission
[2024-01-14 16:43] <zetheroo> 'sudo apt info transmission' shows 'Version: 3.00-2ubuntu2.1'
[2024-01-14 16:44] <tomreyn> okay that seems to cnfirm you have the latest
[2024-01-14 16:47] <zetheroo> there is goes again https://ibb.co/BKRkGLb
[2024-01-14 16:47] <zetheroo> I guess that's just the way it is for me :/
[2024-01-14 16:48] <tomreyn> and the entire system freezes when this happens?
[2024-01-14 16:48] <tomreyn> or is the only thing that happens that you get 0 throughput?
[2024-01-14 16:49] <tomreyn> on the wireless network link
[2024-01-14 16:49] <zetheroo> Sometimes everything freezes up completely, sometimes it's a few apps that are unresponsive and others which are semi-responsive.
[2024-01-14 16:49] <zetheroo> and nothing interesting output to journalctl -f either
[2024-01-14 16:50] <zetheroo> can it not write anything to the log because it's freezing up?
[2024-01-14 16:50] <tomreyn> it would write it later when recovering, if so
[2024-01-14 16:50] <zetheroo> hmm ok
[2024-01-14 16:51] <tomreyn> do you have irqbalance installed?
[2024-01-14 16:51] <oerheks> maybe it is because you torrent wireless, i presume
[2024-01-14 16:51] <zetheroo> not sure - I don't recall installing it
[2024-01-14 16:52] <zetheroo> seems it's already installed
[2024-01-14 16:53] <tomreyn> and this is running on the main operating system, not in a VM, right?
[2024-01-14 16:53] <zetheroo> correct
[2024-01-14 16:53] <zetheroo> no VMs running here
[2024-01-14 16:54] <tomreyn> maybe try running iotop or iostat in a loop
[2024-01-14 16:55] <tomreyn> vmstat in a loo or sar may also hint on what's causing it
[2024-01-14 16:55] <zetheroo> with 'watch'?
[2024-01-14 16:55] <tomreyn> well, you'd want to be able to compare the latest to previous outputs
[2024-01-14 16:56] <tomreyn> if we assume it is somehow related to the wireless link, you could also have a look at    sudo ip -s link
[2024-01-14 16:57] <tomreyn> there should not be lots of "errors" or "dropped" for the wireless on RX or TX
[2024-01-14 16:58] <zetheroo> like this? https://pastebin.com/tMbNP2zF
[2024-01-14 16:58] <tomreyn> that's fine
[2024-01-14 16:59] <tomreyn> although you sent more than you received, interesting
[2024-01-14 16:59] <zetheroo> I'm also uploading to my home server
[2024-01-14 17:00] <tomreyn> at the same time you are trying to do bittorrent? also through wireless?
[2024-01-14 17:00] <tomreyn> get a wire
[2024-01-14 17:01] <zetheroo> Yes. But the feezing up happens also with just a single torrent being downloaded.
[2024-01-14 17:01] <zetheroo> Yeah, I could plug in, but ... meh
[2024-01-14 17:01] <tomreyn> do you know how the bittoreent protocol work?
[2024-01-14 17:01] <tomreyn> s
[2024-01-14 17:01] <zetheroo> Not entirely, no
[2024-01-14 17:02] <zetheroo> btw, I have the seeding massively limited, whereas the downloading isn't at all.
[2024-01-14 17:02] <tomreyn> you connect to multiple peers to download from, at the same time. also other connect to you to download from you (i.e. you upload) the data you are offering.
[2024-01-14 17:04] <zetheroo> Yeah, that much I know. :)
[2024-01-14 17:04] <tomreyn> keeping connections open to many other ends can stress out the system, as can trying to both download and upload through a congested link
[2024-01-14 17:04] <zetheroo> I assume so. I just wish it were easier to see where the bottleneck is.
[2024-01-14 17:04] <tomreyn> wireless is a rather error-prone connectivity, data keeps failing to transfer and need sto be retransmitted all the time. ethernet i a lot more stable
[2024-01-14 17:05] <zetheroo> For sure.
[2024-01-14 17:05] <GrandPa-G> I am struggling getting write permissions on samba share for windows 11 desktop. I can read but not write. Here is smb.conf, mount and permissions. What am I doing wrong? https://dpaste.com/EVFW539PD
[2024-01-14 17:07] <rbox> is it a share from samba or from widnows?
[2024-01-14 17:07] <rbox> where is cifs/smbfs?
[2024-01-14 17:08] <GrandPa-G> the share is on samba. It is actually on a Raspberry pi zero.
[2024-01-14 17:08] <rbox> oh, you're trying to write from windows?
[2024-01-14 17:08] <GrandPa-G> correct
[2024-01-14 17:09] <GrandPa-G> it is a mounted partition on the pi zero
[2024-01-14 17:09] <rbox> if the permission are 777 on the driectory, does it work?
[2024-01-14 17:10] <GrandPa-G> no
[2024-01-14 17:11] <GrandPa-G> shouldn't this change the directory  sudo chmod 777 /mnt/usb_share
[2024-01-14 17:11] <GrandPa-G> ? it gives me drwxr-xr-x 3 usb usb 4096 Dec 31  1969 usb_share
[2024-01-14 17:11] <rbox> you can't chmod on a vfat
[2024-01-14 17:11] <oerheks> GrandPa-G, see force user = myuser > https://askubuntu.com/questions/1466607/how-do-i-get-write-access-to-samba-share-from-guest-account-without-setting-perm
[2024-01-14 17:13] <GrandPa-G> oerheks, can I change something so I don't come in as guest? just take out guest ok?
[2024-01-14 17:15] <oerheks> no, typo
[2024-01-14 17:15] <GrandPa-G> Folks, I just added force user = and it works. Thanks
[2024-01-14 17:15] <oerheks> is this a typo?writable = true
[2024-01-14 17:15] <oerheks> writeable
[2024-01-14 17:16] <GrandPa-G> cut/paste kills you every time. Thanks for that.
[2024-01-14 17:17] <GrandPa-G> oerheks, still needs the force=
[2024-01-14 17:20] <GrandPa-G> FYI - I have a pi zero as gadget. Also, when I put something on its share, the pi zero makes the gadget appear as if it was newly plugged in. I have machine that will recognize that and process the file. It only does it when the flash drive looks like it just was plugged in.

[2024-01-14 18:06] <lunatiq> just trying to use client to connect to my znc on ubuntu
[2024-01-14 18:06] <rbox> huh?

[2024-01-14 18:12] <lunatiq> developers of paraler channel
[2024-01-14 18:12] <lunatiq> DomainSSL error
[2024-01-14 18:24] <tomreyn> chances are that "paraler" and "paralver" refer to https://palaverapp.com/ an iOS IRC client, as I just learnt.
[2024-01-14 18:26] <Habbie> lunatiq, can you show us the error?
[2024-01-14 18:27] <tomreyn> lunatiq: if you are looking for help with configuring your znc running on ubuntu with an X.509 certificate for TLS, a better place to get help with this may be in #znc. we probably won't be able to help with configuring palaver.

[2024-01-15 00:31] <kotgc> dev/sda1
[2024-01-15 00:32] <kotgc> Can the EFI partition be called the root?
[2024-01-15 00:32] <kotgc> I need to mount the EFI to chroot to fix a black screen.
[2024-01-15 00:32] <younder> no, it is only for booting
[2024-01-15 00:33] <kotgc> ok
[2024-01-15 00:36] <kotgc> So I'm planning to "chroot" into the target EFI partition (/dev/sda1), so I think I have to mount /dev/sda1, so grub install/update are correct.

[2024-01-15 02:14] <rbox> ubuntu isn't really designed for selinux
[2024-01-15 02:17] <aiena> what is the correct way to implement MAC in ubuntu?
[2024-01-15 02:18] <rbox> if you want to use selinux, you should progably use a dist designed for selinux, lol
[2024-01-15 02:19] <aiena> rbox, I wa tested selinux in an ubuntu vm so no harm no foul :)
[2024-01-15 02:20] <aiena> rbox, the question is what is the correct mechanism for ubuntu to implement Mandatory access control
[2024-01-15 02:20] <rbox> "AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system"
[2024-01-15 02:21] <aiena> ok I'm reading about it.
[2024-01-15 02:22] <rbox> i mean, that was the very first hit on google...
[2024-01-15 02:26] <aiena> where are snap apparmor policies stored? It seems like ubuntui nforces a policy but I can't find it in /etc/apparmor.d

[2024-01-15 13:16] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-15 13:39] <deadrom> Hi. 20.04 server. DNS set to use DNS server outside. systemd-resolv --status shows desired DNS. dig says 127.0.0.53. internet says this a classic offering 100 solutions. is there a straightforward approach?
[2024-01-15 13:40] <deadrom> 53u+t open, dns not confed to TLS
[2024-01-15 13:49] <pragmaticenigma> deadrom: 127.0.0.53 is a local system caching DNS provider. Almost all installations are setup that way by default to reduce the latency of re-querying a DNS server for something within it TTL property.
[2024-01-15 13:50] <pragmaticenigma> deadrom: your system is querying upstream when it needs to, but if something requests www.example.com and then less than 5ms later does it again, it doesn't have to go all the way to the upstream provider for the second query.
[2024-01-15 13:52] <deadrom> pragmaticenigma: what if the target's IP changes and I got faster then 5ms queries, say edge application
[2024-01-15 13:52] <deadrom> ?
[2024-01-15 13:53] <ikonia> deadrom: you can point directly at a dns server, or you can use the local resolver to forward to a dns server
[2024-01-15 13:54] <pragmaticenigma> deadrom: what do you mean target's UP changes?
[2024-01-15 13:55] <deadrom> well, DNS resolves to a different IP. new instance spawn, new address
[2024-01-15 13:55] <ikonia> that's the dns servers job to maintain a record with the correct TTL
[2024-01-15 13:56] <deadrom> guess azure should do that
[2024-01-15 13:56] <deadrom> uuh root dns
[2024-01-15 13:57] <pragmaticenigma> deadrom: If a domain's IP address changes that frequently it should be defined with a short enough TTL that it wouldn't be a problem. I'm not sure I undersatnd your issue
[2024-01-15 13:57] <ikonia> deadrom: are you trying to host something in Azure and the ip keeps changing ?
[2024-01-15 13:57] <ikonia> what's the actual problem you're trying to solve
[2024-01-15 14:03] <pragmaticenigma> deadrom: systemd-resolvd runs a local caching instance of DNS. resolved will look up an unknown domain at the upstream provider. Any successive queries that occur to that same domain query within the domains defined TTL will be resolved locally. This is to reduce latency of DNS querying and be a good netizen by reducing load on upstream DNS resolvers. If you're hosting a service in Azure that has a frequently changing IP address, that
[2024-01-15 14:03] <pragmaticenigma> DNS record should have a very low TTL so it's not an issue.
[2024-01-15 14:34] <deadrom> ikonia: yes, azure resource with changing IPs, but I think this resolved itself: the differerently reported DNS servers were reported to be an error, turns out people just got jumpy about that but there is no functional impact.
[2024-01-15 14:34] <deadrom> Thanks for the explanation.
[2024-01-15 14:55] <ikonia> glad your sorted
[2024-01-15 15:20] <deadrom> ikonia, ah, edge issue, not linux issue per say. the things you discover when you shake people hard enough
[2024-01-15 15:41] <Guest4> Hey folks,Â I am using Ubuntu 22.04 for the first time, so I have barely experiences and knowledge about it. IÂ´ve got a problem und I would be very happy, if someone could maybe help me. The issue is, that I installed Chrome-Browser to my Cinnamon-GUI and I canÂ´t run it by clicking on the app-symbol. If I do, a clock is displayed (loading
[2024-01-15 15:41] <Guest4> process?!) and after a few seconds it dissapers, the cursor shows up again and nothing happens. The only way for me to start Chrome so far is via terminal, using the --no-sandbox command, but this is quiet not the best way, as I read on the Internet. If I try to start it as a non-root user via terminal, the following error is presented: âMissing
[2024-01-15 15:41] <Guest4> X Server or $Display. The platform failed to initialize. Exiting.â I am using Ubuntu through VNC.
[2024-01-15 15:44] <rbox> what do yoj mean start it as a non root user via teerminal
[2024-01-15 15:44] <rbox> you should be starting it ast he user logged in to X
[2024-01-15 15:47] <Guest4> as a standard user without administration rights. Can you maybe explain shortly what is X?
[2024-01-15 15:47] <rbox> the user logged in to the graphical system
[2024-01-15 15:55] <ioria> Guest30, maybe the .desktop launcher is not set correctly; look at  ~/.local/share/applications/   and /usr/share/applications
[2024-01-15 16:07] <pragmaticenigma> Guest30: You should not be logged in as root, at any time, with exception for system specific maintaince, which commonly can be accomplished by preceeding a command with "sudo " and then enternig your user (not root) password. Google Chrome is not distributed by Ubuntu, it is considered a thirdparty application and you will have to seek help from their community. You can install the chromium browser which is offered through the Software
[2024-01-15 16:07] <pragmaticenigma> intaller/package manager. That package is called "chromium-browser"
[2024-01-15 16:09] <pragmaticenigma> Guest30: If you wish to install 3rd party applications like Google Chrome, make sure you are getting the software from the official sources and following their instructions exactly (read instructions twice before performing any action.)
[2024-01-15 16:21] <wyre> hi guys! I'm trying to show my hidden grub by holding esc key ...
[2024-01-15 16:21] <wyre> and I can see the grub cli
[2024-01-15 16:21] <wyre> but I'd like to see the grub menu to add some parameters to my kernel command line
[2024-01-15 16:22] <rbox> hit esc again
[2024-01-15 16:22] <rbox> it should take you back to the menu
[2024-01-15 16:23] <howudodat> I am trying to set up NVS4.2 server.  I already have samba fs, samba ad, and windows, mac, linux clients working (all linux running 22.04).  Now I want to add a NFS server that also uses AD for kerberos and for extended ACLs.  Can anyone recemmend a good guide on this?
[2024-01-15 16:23] <wyre> rbox, hitting esc is like printing a new line
[2024-01-15 16:26] <rbox> weirds
[2024-01-15 16:26] <rbox> im sure i've done that before
[2024-01-15 16:27] <pragmaticenigma> howudodat: You may find more server specific help in #ubuntu-server
[2024-01-15 16:27] <rbox> what if you hold shift instead of hitting esc on boot?
[2024-01-15 16:27] <wyre> rbox, the boot process continues
[2024-01-15 16:27] <rbox> well dont hold esc, just tap it
[2024-01-15 16:27] <pragmaticenigma> wyre: are you trying to make a permanent change, or just testing a temporary one?
[2024-01-15 16:28] <Guest30> rbox ioria pragmaticenigma Thanks for your advices. I set up the GUI by myself and read something about I had to install xorg in advance, which I didnÂ´t. Could this also be a reason why Chrome is not running?
[2024-01-15 16:29] <rbox> Guest30: if you dont know what you are doing, its best to just do a normal install
[2024-01-15 16:29] <wyre> pragmaticenigma, just testing a temporary one
[2024-01-15 16:29] <wyre> but more than that ... I'd like to edit the /etc/fstab
[2024-01-15 16:29] <wyre> it seems to have a wrong entry
[2024-01-15 16:30] <howudodat> pragmaticenigma: thanks, I've been lurking there for several days.  I guess I can post there again
[2024-01-15 16:33] <pragmaticenigma> Guest30: With your first go at this, you should use a ready to go install of your preferred setup. You can get the unofficial (which means it is not supported here) Ubuntu Cinnamon installer from https://ubuntucinnamon.org/.  Or for a Gnome2 classic experience you can try Ubuntu MATE which is a supported and official flavor of UBuntu from https://ubuntu-mate.org/
[2024-01-15 16:37] <pragmaticenigma> howudodat: What you're asking for assistance on, is beyond what a typical user of the Desktop version of Ubuntu would do. That is why I suggested the other channel. If you're not having luck there you can use the IRC command '/msg alis list {keyword}' to see if another channel might be more targeted to your need. Other options might be #linux (which is very general) or you may have to find a community through a web search.
[2024-01-15 16:38] <howudodat> pragmaticenigma: understood.  I posted again in ubunut-server as well as #nfs, I'll see what happens, if not well...I'll keep looking
[2024-01-15 16:38] <howudodat> if it were easy, everyone would do it (tm)...:)

[2024-01-15 16:43] <nonix4> Is there a way to disable DPMS at login/lock screen? (as in blacklist it for video drivers and/or monitors which are incompatible with blanking)

[2024-01-15 16:58] <webchat3> hello
[2024-01-15 16:59] <webchat3> so, I just bought a dell vostro with ubuntu, i created the account set pass etc. I want to return the laptop because I do not like it
[2024-01-15 16:59] <webchat3> my ask is, how to delete the user ?
[2024-01-15 17:00] <webchat3> i tried all commands on internet but doesn t working
[2024-01-15 17:00] <webchat3> please help me
[2024-01-15 17:00] <webchat3> error code 8
[2024-01-15 17:00] <rbox> why do yo uneed to delete the user?
[2024-01-15 17:01] <webchat3> because i send the laptop back\
[2024-01-15 17:01] <webchat3> if I send back a laptop with password set up I think is not ok
[2024-01-15 17:01] <rbox> did they tell you to do anythign?
[2024-01-15 17:01] <rbox> they're just going tow ipe it
[2024-01-15 17:01] <rbox> lol
[2024-01-15 17:02] <webchat3> what are you saying ? just send it back ?
[2024-01-15 17:03] <rbox> do whatever they tell you to do
[2024-01-15 17:03] <rbox> did they tell you to woryr about anything?
[2024-01-15 17:04] <webchat3> is writed on site that if you make a return that laptop be unlocked
[2024-01-15 17:04] <webchat3> but how to unlock it?
[2024-01-15 17:04] <webchat3> i deleted all filles etc
[2024-01-15 17:04] <rbox> adding a user account isnt locking anything
[2024-01-15 17:04] <rbox> if you're unsure about their instructinos, you should ask them
[2024-01-15 17:05] <webchat3> my ask is how can I deleted my account
[2024-01-15 17:06] <arraybolt3> webchat3: You shouldn't send back a computer that you put any personal data on unless *you* wipe it first. You technically *can* delete the only user account on the system, but if anything that will lock it *worse*.
[2024-01-15 17:06] <nonix4> actually many wouldn't settle with deleting files, instead they'd overwrite the filesystem and reinstall (with minimal image to keep it simple/fast)
[2024-01-15 17:07] <arraybolt3> If you want to fully "unlock" the machine, the right way to do that would be to make sure they have your password, or delete the password entirely.
[2024-01-15 17:07] <webchat3> this is what I m saiyng, how to delete anything from this laptop, my personal data
[2024-01-15 17:07] <webchat3> how to delete the password
[2024-01-15 17:08] <arraybolt3> webchat3: download the same version of Ubuntu that is installed on the machine, and reinstall from scratch. Preferably scrub the entire drive using GNOME Disks (I think it can do that?) before installing.
[2024-01-15 17:08] <webchat3> IT IS SO COMPLICATED
[2024-01-15 17:08] <nonix4> I'd just overwrite the hd once with random noise, once with zeros and once with netboot image and call it done
[2024-01-15 17:09] <arraybolt3> webchat3: it would be this complicated with Windows too :-/
[2024-01-15 17:09] <arraybolt3> This is data security - if you save data to a drive, simply "deleting" it leaves pieces on the drive. If you want to make sure no one resurrects your old deleted data and steals it, you have to wipe the drive.
[2024-01-15 17:10] <nonix4> (actually major part of hds/ssds these days do have a secure erase command which is fast, if you choose to trust the hw manufacturer)
[2024-01-15 17:10] <arraybolt3> webchat3: who did you buy this machine from?
[2024-01-15 17:11] <arraybolt3> a particular company? Did you buy from Dell directly? Or did you buy from some third party?
[2024-01-15 17:11] <webchat3> #arraybolt3 me
[2024-01-15 17:11] <webchat3> from third party
[2024-01-15 17:13] <arraybolt3> yeah. So you really should probably download Ubuntu from here: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop then flash it to a USB drive, then use the "Disks" utility to zero out the internal drive, and then reinstall Ubuntu. Set a simple short password and make sure the seller knows that password when you send it back.
[2024-01-15 17:19] <webchat65> hi
[2024-01-15 17:25] <Guest47> For now the (hopefully) last question about using a browser on a Cinnamon-GUI: I can run Firefox instead of Chrome, but when itÂ´s open, I canÂ´t type anything, and just act by writing my commands into a Text Editor and then just copy paste it via mouse click into Firefox. So itÂ´s not reacting to keyboard inputs. Is there maybe an easy way to fix
[2024-01-15 17:25] <Guest47> it?
[2024-01-15 17:26] <howudodat> I would add a new user, give them sudo rights, login as them, then delete your user, rm -fr /home/<old username>
[2024-01-15 17:33] <Guest888> Hi, ipv6 newbie here. So, my ISP provide ipv6 , how do I set static ipv6 address on ubuntu pc
[2024-01-15 17:34] <Guest888> Can anyone help me?
[2024-01-15 17:35] <arraybolt3> Guest888: People are here to help, but if this is a server machine it might be better to try #ubuntu-server.
[2024-01-15 17:35] <nonix4> Guest888: Do they actually sell you stable prefix? Otherwise configuring stable suffix won't help much.
[2024-01-15 17:35] <arraybolt3> Otherwise, this is a great place.
[2024-01-15 17:36] <ubuntu_user_42> Hello, is there a way to install nm-connection-editor without installing Gnome Shell and its dependencies, akin to how Arch Linux does it?
[2024-01-15 17:37] <nonix4> Guest888: but indeed may want to utilize netplan.io and systemd-networkd instead of networkmanager if the use scenario even slightly resembles servers
[2024-01-15 17:38] <rbox> ubuntu_user_42: how are you trying to install it?
[2024-01-15 17:39] <ubuntu_user_42> It seems to be contained in network-manager-gnome, which is weird, because I remember having a package called network-manager-applet
[2024-01-15 17:40] <Guest888> nonix4: what do you mean by stable prefix? I check my router, everytimes it restart the 1st 3 field (eg.. 2001:0DB8:face::) does not change.
[2024-01-15 17:41] <Guest888> nonix4: and have "/64" on the router interface
[2024-01-15 17:45] <ubuntu_user_42> Okay, I got it work with the Fedora package for nm-connection-editor + Alien. Probably not the best way to do it, but it seems to work just fine.
[2024-01-15 17:45] <rbox> ubuntu_user_42: thanks for the play by play
[2024-01-15 17:47] <arraybolt3> ubuntu_user_42: nm-connection-editor doesn't usually require GNOME Shell I don't think?
[2024-01-15 17:47] <arraybolt3> just `sudo apt install nm-connection-editor` should have done the trick, but perhaps `sudo apt install --no-install-recommends nm-connection-editor` would help
[2024-01-15 17:47] <ubuntu_user_42> There is no nm-connection-editor package
[2024-01-15 17:48] <arraybolt3> oh you're right
[2024-01-15 17:48] <ubuntu_user_42> That is the problem, it used to network-manager-applet, which apparently got removed and merged with network-manager-gnome? Not sure. Like I said, I remember having network-manager-applet
[2024-01-15 17:48] <ubuntu_user_42> s/used to/used to be
[2024-01-15 17:48] <arraybolt3> gnome-shell is a Recommends of network-manager-gnome
[2024-01-15 17:48] <arraybolt3> so it might work to `sudo apt install --no-install-recomments network-manager-gnome`
[2024-01-15 17:49] <ubuntu_user_42> Doesn't look like it. Even with --no-install-recommends, `gnome-shell` is installed, alongside with `mutter-common` and all the libraries gnome-shell would require
[2024-01-15 17:50] <arraybolt3> weird
[2024-01-15 17:54] <nonix4> ubuntu_user_42: it depends on gnome-shell | policykit-1-gnome | polkit-1-auth-agent -- so maybe install one of the polkit ones first?
[2024-01-15 17:55] <ubuntu_user_42> Darn, that worked!
[2024-01-15 17:56] <ubuntu_user_42> Thanks a lot
[2024-01-15 17:56] <arraybolt3> \o/
[2024-01-15 17:56] <arraybolt3> nonix4: nice going!
[2024-01-15 19:55] <zeratul> if I want to extend the sudo timeout where in the visudo file do I add that setting?
[2024-01-15 20:33] <pragmaticenigma> zeratul: First make sure you keep a copy of the original line, the alter the line `Defaults env_reset` to `Defaults env_reset, timestamp_timeout=5` where the number 5 represents the number of minutes you wish sudo to remain active.
[2024-01-15 20:33] <pragmaticenigma> zeratul: you are simply adding the `, timestamp_timeout=5` after the original entry
[2024-01-15 20:47] <zeratul> pragmaticenigma, why the , after Defaults env_reset ???
[2024-01-15 20:55] <pragmaticenigma> zeratul: You are welcome to take a look at https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sudoers.5.html for that information

[2024-01-15 22:12] <rbox> yeah, looks like some kind of a hardware error
[2024-01-15 22:13] <messier16> does this indicate it is, specifically, the /dev/sda drive? mediamagnate kernel: [293456.821909] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 888202112 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 32 prio class 0
[2024-01-15 22:13] <messier16> there are four internal drives
[2024-01-15 22:13] <rbox> well it says sda
[2024-01-15 22:14] <rbox> it woudnl't say sda if it was about sdd
[2024-01-15 22:14] <messier16> ok
[2024-01-15 22:14] <messier16> that's what I thought but I don't have enough experience to know for sure
[2024-01-15 22:14] <messier16> thank you rbox
[2024-01-15 22:16] <tomreyn> messier16: what yuo should take note of is ther serial number of the drive you want to replace. smatctl is one of the tools reporting that.
[2024-01-15 22:18] <tomreyn> while 'sda' means 'first sata drive', what actually is 'the first', as seen by the running system, may be more difficult to match tho the installed disks when opening the case.
[2024-01-15 22:18] <tomreyn> serial numbers are usually printed on HDD labels.
[2024-01-15 22:19] <messier16> well, luckily.. all drives are different sizes. so identification should be fairly easy. I think.
[2024-01-15 22:19] <messier16> but thank you for the info and the tip
[2024-01-15 22:23] <messier16> there's an odd thing - the only time I get the error messages is when a drive is connected via an external USB cable - it's in one of those drive bays. but the /dev/sda drive is definitely a 4tb internal seagate.
[2024-01-15 22:24] <messier16> alright I'm running a long smartctl test on this drive as test results showed I'd only done a short test, which it passed. I could have sworn I did a long test as well. Thank you for your time.
[2024-01-15 22:27] <Aavar> I just upgraded to 22.04 and I have a script that among other things runs "zpool status -v" to check the status of my zfs. When I run it I get this message: https://dpaste.com/34HH2U7XE Is it safe for me to run "zpool upgrade"?
[2024-01-15 22:28] <rbox> Aavar: you should back up your data to be sure
[2024-01-15 22:33] <Aavar> rbox: it is bankes up, but it is far away and will take a long time to recover. Is it a bad idea to just leave it?
[2024-01-15 22:34] <rbox> well some features wont be used
[2024-01-15 22:41] <pragmaticenigma> Aavar: a remote backup is not a backup... harddrives are relatively cheap, and ideal for making sure you have a local backup
[2024-01-15 22:41] <pragmaticenigma> Aavar: More specifically 3-2-1 should be considered the back up strategy. 3 backups, with 2 on different media, and one remotely stored
[2024-01-15 22:42] <Aavar> pragmaticenigma: I know, but this is not important data. It is only inconvenient to loose it
[2024-01-15 22:43] <pragmaticenigma> then it's important data :P
[2024-01-15 22:44] <Aavar> pragmaticenigma: if you call old linux ISOs that I might install again important, then yes. Ripping the ISOs is quite time consuming
[2024-01-15 22:46] <Aavar> pragmaticenigma: :P
[2024-01-15 23:00] <Luiserebii> Hello, I am looking to update my vim. I see it is at `version 8.1.1847` when I open it. However, when I try to update it via `sudo apt-get install vim`, I see: `vim is already the newest version (2:8.1.2269-1ubuntu5.21).`
[2024-01-15 23:00] <Luiserebii> Why is there that version discrepancy?
[2024-01-15 23:02] <Aavar> Luiserebii: because i'ts not upgraded in the repository yet. I guess.
[2024-01-15 23:02] <Bashing-om> !latest | Luiserebii
[2024-01-15 23:02] <ubottu> Luiserebii: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[2024-01-15 23:02] <Bashing-om> !info vim lunar
[2024-01-15 23:02] <ubottu> 'lunar' is not a valid release
[2024-01-15 23:04] <Luiserebii> Is there a safe way that I can install the newest version while keeping the package via `apt-get`? Or will I just have to uninstall it and install it a different way?
[2024-01-15 23:04] <Luiserebii> Or at least, a newer version?
[2024-01-15 23:04] <rbox> you can find some random ppa
[2024-01-15 23:04] <rbox> or you can compile it
[2024-01-15 23:05] <rbox> Luiserebii: you can find some random ppa, or you can compile it
[2024-01-15 23:07] <Luiserebii> Hmmmm
[2024-01-15 23:07] <Aavar> Luiserebii: have you checked what version is in snap?
[2024-01-15 23:08] <Luiserebii> I admit, I'm a bit confused. I see: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vim/2:9.0.1672-1ubuntu2.2. Is there a way I can pull this in and install it via apt-get?
[2024-01-15 23:08] <tomreyn> Luiserebii: you run ubuntu 20.04 LTS apparently. there are newer releases you could upgrade to, and those provided newer versions of vim, too.
[2024-01-15 23:08] <Luiserebii> Aavar: I have not seen it, but I am afraid of conflicts with apt-get. Would I have to uninstall vim via apt-get to be safe?
[2024-01-15 23:08] <tomreyn> newer *Ubuntu* releases, providing newer versions of vim
[2024-01-15 23:09] <Aavar> Luiserebii: snap will never conflict with apt.
[2024-01-15 23:10] <Luiserebii> Ohhh, I see, I am on 20.04 LTS, yes... darn. I guess I have to make the move up soon. I've been putting it off partially because I've become comfortable with my customization on 20.04 haha
[2024-01-15 23:11] <tomreyn> maybe you can keep them, or most of them.
[2024-01-15 23:12] <tomreyn> becoming too dependant on customizations to be able to upgrade is risk you should not take.
[2024-01-15 23:12] <tomreyn> better go with the flow, accept some minor level of imperfection
[2024-01-15 23:12] <Luiserebii> Oh, yes, I suppose that is wise.
[2024-01-15 23:15] <tomreyn> 22.04 LTS is the current long term support release, the next one will be 24.04, and those version numbers are actually YY.MM, year and month, of when they release
[2024-01-15 23:15] <jeremy31> Basically the LTS is the .04 release of an even number year
[2024-01-15 23:16] <Aavar> Luiserebii: 8.2 is in 22.04, but also in snap. Just run "sudo snap install --beta vim-editor" and you will have a newer version.
[2024-01-15 23:17] <tomreyn> https://snapcraft.io/vim-editor provides a may 2020 "beta" channel providing 8.2.788, that's too old to be recommendable.
[2024-01-15 23:17] <tomreyn> as in, not maintained for 4 years, unlike the .deb's, which do get security patches.
[2024-01-15 23:18] <Aavar> tomreyn: I stand corrected.
[2024-01-15 23:19] <Luiserebii> I did find a ppa that I was able to update to. Thank you so much for all your help!
[2024-01-15 23:19] <tomreyn> Aavar: well. this version IS newer / higher than the one Luiserebii has now (though hers will have security and bug fixes, whereas the snap one won't have them since)
[2024-01-15 23:21] <tomreyn> Luiserebii: be aware that ppa's may provde no security patches either. it entirely depends on their maintainers and whether they care about it (which they don#t need to do).
[2024-01-15 23:21] <Luiserebii> I managed to push it to vim 9 using the PPA, but I would think the next priority is getting to 22.04 or maybe the 24 LTS (when it releases)
[2024-01-15 23:23] <Aavar> Luiserebii: I recommend doing it in steps. In my experience, upgrading two versions has more potential problems than one.
[2024-01-15 23:26] <Luiserebii> Ahhh, ok. I will definitely follow that advice. Thank you again!
[2024-01-15 23:31] <tomreyn> Luiserebii: which PPA are you using then? one of jonathanf's?
[2024-01-15 23:31] <ogra_> als note tat adding a PPA effectiveky gives the PPA owner root access to your system (via dpkg maintainer scripts the packags can do anything they want) so think about how much you trust such a particular PPA owner
[2024-01-15 23:39] <dtype> are there popular third party PPAs that are lower barrier to entry than official Ubuntu, for folks wiling to do some work but not wanting to introduce the trust problem of another PPA?
[2024-01-15 23:41] <tomreyn> pick some software you like, look for available PPAs, see what you can contribute
[2024-01-15 23:42] <ogra_> well, PPAs always have that trust problem ... thats due to the design of dpkg/apt ...
[2024-01-15 23:42] <dtype> i mean, i'm doing a project that needs to distribute a little python script as a collection point, and would like to give folks an option to install more correctly, but it isn't big enough to end up in Ubuntu proper
[2024-01-15 23:42] <dtype> i could just do my own PPA, but then of course the trust issue
[2024-01-15 23:43] <pragmaticenigma> dtype: A python script should be packaged within python and installed in a venv at the end user using pip
[2024-01-15 23:43] <ogra_> luckily PPAs always include the source packges so you *can* inspect what they are doing ... but you indeed need the knowledge and invst some time
[2024-01-15 23:43] <dtype> pragmaticenigma: it needs to run on systemd/cron as part of the install
[2024-01-15 23:43] <ogra_> (and nothing stops the owner of introducing something evil with the next updae indeed)
[2024-01-15 23:44] <pragmaticenigma> dtype: You can run a script from within a venv from cron very easiliy
[2024-01-15 23:44] <dtype> sure, can consider that as an option
[2024-01-15 23:45] <dtype> fwiw, doesn't have to be python but it is in practice today
[2024-01-15 23:47] <pragmaticenigma> I think the part that is missing is that channels like this one consider 3rd party PPAs contributing to an unsupported installation of Ubuntu. It's one of the first things a volunteer here will tell someone to remove before attempting to troubleshoot a system
[2024-01-15 23:48] <JanC> there isn't really much different between a distro and a PPA when it comes to "trust", just that you have to trust an extra person/group, and you have to make the same considerations to judge them
[2024-01-15 23:51] <dtype> pragmaticenigma: I had the same thing with a perl script like 25 years ago that became popular and you can still install today in about every distribution, even though it is not great programming
[2024-01-15 23:52] <pragmaticenigma> 99% of programs were just someone's quick fix that "worked" and for fear of breaking things never get touched again
[2024-01-15 23:52] <dtype> still odd to me that you can `apt-get install ethstats` which was some hacky thing from ~2000
[2024-01-15 23:53] <arraybolt3> well people liked it and the package hasn't broken yet :)
[2024-01-15 23:53] <arraybolt3> dtype: have you considered making it a Snap?
[2024-01-15 23:53] <dtype> i haven't touched it in 22 years
[2024-01-15 23:54] <arraybolt3> I mean the new script
[2024-01-15 23:54] <arraybolt3> Those don't require any scary PPA addition steps to install, the tool to install them is built into Ubuntu, and they oftentimes work well if you know what you're doing with confinement
[2024-01-15 23:54] <pragmaticenigma> are you sure it's the same thing... a search of ethstats turns up an ethereum
[2024-01-15 23:54] <pragmaticenigma>  block chain
[2024-01-15 23:54] <pragmaticenigma> monitor
[2024-01-15 23:54] <dtype> oh, it isn't that kind of thing. see https://dmon.io. my new project here is just a free/libre external service for monitoring device stuff. I think I can probably make it forever hosted free.
[2024-01-15 23:55] <dtype> i guess it *could* be a snap
[2024-01-15 23:55] <arraybolt3> if you want something a little easier to install that doesn't require PPA gymnastics to work, that would be the Ubuntu way of doing things.
[2024-01-15 23:56] <arraybolt3> And it's cross-distro compatible, although it requires the end user to be willing to install Snap on non-Ubuntu distros.
[2024-01-15 23:56] <dtype> ethstats/jammy 1.2.1-4 all
[2024-01-15 23:56] <dtype>   script that quickly measures network device throughput
[2024-01-15 23:56] <dtype> pragmaticenigma: ^^ that one
[2024-01-15 23:56] <dtype> probably won't google very well since it is literally a perl script from 2000 with no further presence
[2024-01-15 23:57] <dtype> anyway wasn't here to sell ethstats. just noting it as an example of a litlte utility thing that ended up in stock repos
[2024-01-15 23:57] <dtype> arraybolt3: yeah noted. maybe a little snap would be the way to go
[2024-01-15 23:58] <dtype> needs read access to /sys but that should be doable maybe.
[2024-01-15 23:59] <dtype> (nothing that isnât world readable anyway)
[2024-01-16 00:00] <JanC> or you can do all of them so people can choose  ;)
[2024-01-16 00:07] <dtype> thanks for ideas here folks.

[2024-01-16 08:01] <BlueSmoke> I'm using Ubuntu 20.04
[2024-01-16 08:04] <BlueSmoke> If it helps it acts the same on en and us settings

[2024-01-16 08:16] <BlueSmoke> if thats what you were asking
[2024-01-16 08:18] <BlueSmoke> It's a laptop with shared num pad
[2024-01-16 08:19] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: I expected the keyboard layout (such as pc105) to also be configured.
[2024-01-16 08:19] <BlueSmoke> what I posted is all thats in there
[2024-01-16 08:28] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Will take one more knowledgeable than I to determine what the layout should be - past my bed time and I am headed that way.
[2024-01-16 08:28] <BlueSmoke> Thanks for looking at It anyway good night
[2024-01-16 08:34] <thisisjaymehta> I have similar but different issue like BlueSmoke.
[2024-01-16 08:35] <thisisjaymehta> in my case function key not works, I tried many different keyboard layouts in settings
[2024-01-16 08:36] <thisisjaymehta> I am using "helloganss" keyboard and it only support win and mac. But I am trying to make all keys work on ubuntu.
[2024-01-16 08:36] <BlueSmoke> I looked at posts all ove the place but there are many different so it confuses the search thats why I thought I'd ask here hoping someone could put me on the right parth
[2024-01-16 08:38] <BlueSmoke> Mine when I hold left shif the afected key do nothing
[2024-01-16 08:39] <BlueSmoke> mine includes some Fkeys also but not many

[2024-01-16 14:55] <glumbletross> @pragmaticenigma, yes, why is my system encryption keys keep crashing right after login?

[2024-01-16 16:42] <strk> is there a way to search for source packages ?
[2024-01-16 16:42] <strk> with apt
[2024-01-16 16:43] <strk> based on https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/libs/libgeos3.10.2 I go: `apt source libgeos3.10.2` but I get: E: Unable to find a source package for libgeos3.10.2
[2024-01-16 16:44] <strk> I do have `deb-src http://no.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy main` in /etc/apt/source.list
[2024-01-16 16:45] <leftyfb> strk: libgeos3.10.2 is part of the universe repository
[2024-01-16 16:47] <strk> ah, why, if I may ask ?
[2024-01-16 16:48] <leftyfb> you could contact ubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com to find out
[2024-01-16 16:48] <pragmaticenigma> strk: Universe is where community maintained packages are stored. Main is for Canonical-supported
[2024-01-16 17:27] <strk> how can I completely update the source code in a source package ?
[2024-01-16 17:30] <pragmaticenigma> strk: Think you'd have to reach out to the mail list email that lefty mentioned earlier for that answer.
[2024-01-16 17:38] <armadefuego> Anyone out there that can give me suggestions on what to look at with a problem that my mouse won't select windows? ( i can use the keyboard to change windows)
[2024-01-16 17:39] <leftyfb> huh?
[2024-01-16 17:40] <leftyfb> armadefuego: can you take a screenshot or picture?
[2024-01-16 17:40] <leftyfb> of the screen where you're trying to "select windows"
[2024-01-16 17:40] <strk> how do I search for a package by partial name ? is there any such service for source pakcage on commandline ?
[2024-01-16 17:40] <armadefuego> Also can't use the dash, or the _chrome_ on the window via the mouse.
[2024-01-16 17:41] <leftyfb> armadefuego: are you sure the mouse button works?
[2024-01-16 17:41] <armadefuego> @strk: i use dpkg -l | grep {name}
[2024-01-16 17:41] <strk> armadefuego: that one only searches in the installed packages, I'm talking about searching in all packages
[2024-01-16 17:41] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego: doesn't that only search already installed packages?
[2024-01-16 17:41] <armadefuego> @leftyb: all 3 of them! ( i have 3 mice on the machine)
[2024-01-16 17:41] <strk> like: apt search # but for source packages
[2024-01-16 17:42] <webchat95> I have just installed ubuntu 22.04 and now my speaker is not working the audio is coming from my headphone but not from speakers
[2024-01-16 17:42] <armadefuego> for all packages i just use the ubuntu site.
[2024-01-16 17:42] <pragmaticenigma> webchat95: unplug headphones
[2024-01-16 17:43] <webchat95> : ) now also not coming
[2024-01-16 17:43] <armadefuego> @webchat95: can i assume that the headphone is disconnected when you test the speakers?
[2024-01-16 17:43] <webchat95> armadefuego yes
[2024-01-16 17:44] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego: if you're receiving help, it's best to refrain from helping others. it makes it really hard to know when you are replying to someone helping you, or if you're helping someone else
[2024-01-16 17:45] <armadefuego> @webchat95 is the setup in settings appropriate for your speakers? ( there may be options that the soundcard doesn't support to your speakers.
[2024-01-16 17:46] <leftyfb> armadefuego: try 1 mouse at a time
[2024-01-16 17:46] <webchat95> armadefuego in settings the output device is showing
[2024-01-16 17:47] <strk> debhelper is already the newest version (12.10ubuntu1). # this prevents me to build backports requiring version 13, how do I go about that ?
[2024-01-16 17:53] <armadefuego1> Disconnecting the mouse ( and a screen) crashed my GUI!
[2024-01-16 17:54] <leftyfb> armadefuego1: what release of ubuntu is this? It doesn't sound stock
[2024-01-16 17:57] <armadefuego1> 23.10. Pretty much stock.
[2024-01-16 17:59] <armadefuego1> node and chrome are the only _unubuntu repos in my apt sources ( from what i can see)
[2024-01-16 18:01] <leftyfb> armadefuego1: you mean beyond the stock sources.list right?
[2024-01-16 18:02] <armadefuego1> yes.
[2024-01-16 18:05] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego1: after rebooting are you still experiencing the issue?
[2024-01-16 18:06] <armadefuego1> restarting the GUI makes the issue disappear for a while.
[2024-01-16 18:07] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego1: with all three mice attached to the system?
[2024-01-16 18:08] <armadefuego1> (switching GUI consoles (<CTL><ALT><F1>    === <CTL><ALT><F2>) makes the mouse behave normally, for a bit)
[2024-01-16 18:08] <armadefuego1> yes.
[2024-01-16 18:08] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego1: why three mice?
[2024-01-16 18:09] <leftyfb> armadefuego1: only plug in 1 mouse at a time and see if the issue still happens
[2024-01-16 18:09] <armadefuego1> the mice, when experiencing the issue, all work _normally_ within the window. But not in the window decorations ( menu bars)
[2024-01-16 18:11] <armadefuego1> it seems its the window manager, not the window, in X terms anyway.
[2024-01-16 18:12] <pragmaticenigma> I'm going to go with this being self inflicted armadefuego1 ... as it appears there's no attempt at resolving the issue, just more anecdotal commentary that doesn't really get to the root of the problem of what probably is an edge case which is most computers are not operated with more than one mouse at a time.
[2024-01-16 18:12] <pragmaticenigma> without you explaining why three mice, and actually following the suggestions of reducing the count to 1 and see if the problem occurs
[2024-01-16 18:12] <armadefuego1> Sorry. I am just looking for what i need to include in a bug issue.
[2024-01-16 18:13] <pragmaticenigma> it's not a bug
[2024-01-16 18:13] <pragmaticenigma> you have an edge case, and at the moment is going to get flagged with "won't fix" because of using three mice without explination why there is need for such an arrangement, and whether or not the problem happens with only one mouse attached
[2024-01-16 18:14] <armadefuego1> So which file do i look at to see that the _crash_ wasn't a crash?
[2024-01-16 18:14] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego1: done helping you... since it appears you're not really experiencing a problem. just wasting people's time
[2024-01-16 18:14] <leftyfb> armadefuego1: let us know when you would like our help by providing answers to the questions that have been asked
[2024-01-16 18:18] <armadefuego1> I am sorry i missed a question
[2024-01-16 18:18] <armadefuego1> 3 mice: Track ball, trackpad, standard mouse.
[2024-01-16 18:19] <armadefuego1> the _trackball_ is the additional, i think.
[2024-01-16 18:19] <leftyfb> unplug all but 1
[2024-01-16 18:20] <armadefuego1> I did that, and i go the _oh! snap_ screen.
[2024-01-16 18:20] <leftyfb> armadefuego1: unplug all but 1 and reboot
[2024-01-16 18:21] <armadefuego1> Ok. I will try that for a day, or so.

[2024-01-16 18:23] <pragmaticenigma> I have never heard of an "Oh Snap" screen in ubuntu... only the "Aw, Snap" in Chrome... me thinks this is a developer and is playing with WebRTC controls
[2024-01-16 18:24] <pragmaticenigma> locking up the control of the mouse
[2024-01-16 18:24] <leftyfb> they left
[2024-01-16 18:24] <pragmaticenigma> i know... that's why I mentioned it
[2024-01-16 18:27] <armadefuego> rebooted with the one mouse.
[2024-01-16 18:27] <armadefuego> Thanks for the suggestion
[2024-01-16 18:29] <pragmaticenigma> armadefuego: Something of interest. There is no "Oh Snap" error message that I am aware of in Ubuntu. Only time I have seen such an error screen is from Google Chrome. Seeing that you have node.js repository, I'm going to assume you are a developer. Are you working on some sort of hardware WebRTC project with Google Chrome involving pointing devices?
[2024-01-16 18:31] <armadefuego> No.
[2024-01-16 18:31] <armadefuego> I use 2 mice because the regular mouse is _familiar_. the trackpad is good for drawing. the trackball saves my wrist.
[2024-01-16 18:32] <leftyfb> you can only use 1 at a time
[2024-01-16 18:32] <armadefuego> I am no longer an active developer. but i keep my hands dirty, sometimes.
[2024-01-16 18:33] <armadefuego> well, sometimes i 2-hand mouse ;)
[2024-01-16 18:34] <leftyfb> sorry, but I doubt that
[2024-01-16 18:34] <armadefuego> (the regular mouse has 5 buttons, the trackpad only 3!
[2024-01-16 18:35] <armadefuego> ok. sorry. 50 years of using mice i can. ( gamers use a keyboard, and a mouse at the same time, for certain games to control movement.
[2024-01-16 18:35] <armadefuego> i guess its all what you are used to.
[2024-01-16 18:51] <strk> how do I downgrade a package ?
[2024-01-16 18:52] <strk> I built a custom one with a newer version and now I'd like to move back
[2024-01-16 18:52] <strk> oh, appending =<oldversion> works
[2024-01-16 19:57] <tomreyn> strk: this will last until the next time you install upgrades
[2024-01-16 19:58] <tomreyn> apt pinning is an apt mechanism which can prevent upgrades. obviously, doing so also introduces security risks / prevents patching of vulnerabilities
[2024-01-16 20:14] <dob1_> hi, why with kernel 6.5.0-14-generic gcc-12 was not installed ?
[2024-01-16 20:16] <pragmaticenigma> dob1_: You'll have to explain why you expect a kernel update to also install a compiler update
[2024-01-16 20:17] <dob1_> pragmaticenigma: the problem: I was installing virtualbox (the one from virtualbox repository), the build of the module fails because gcc-12 was not installed and gcc-12 is the compiler defined by the kernel
[2024-01-16 20:17] <dob1_> *failed
[2024-01-16 20:19] <ravage> that is a question you have to ask the virtualbox repository maintainer then
[2024-01-16 20:19] <dob1_> they say this
[2024-01-16 20:23] <pragmaticenigma> dob1_: There is a virtual box package in Ubuntu's support repositories. It is highly recommended that you use that one, as it is built and conforms to the available packages for Ubuntu.
[2024-01-16 20:23] <pragmaticenigma> *Ubuntu's supported repositories
[2024-01-16 20:25] <dob1_> pragmaticenigma: sorry but imho this is not the point
[2024-01-16 20:26] <pragmaticenigma> !latest | dob1_
[2024-01-16 20:26] <ubottu> dob1_: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[2024-01-16 20:28] <pragmaticenigma> dob1_: It is every bit the point. You came here expecting something to work, where you made the choice to use an unsupported package repository. In doing so, there's no help here for your situation. The suggestion of using the package already offered in the repository is because it is supported here, and we can help with issues you may have in using it.
[2024-01-16 20:29] <pragmaticenigma> dob1_: Also worth noting, the repository from Oracle for VirtualBox is well known for breaking Ubuntu installs. I've had several of my past installations break because of it. Oracle commonly provides packages for other supporting libraries that break other funcationality in Ubuntu
[2024-01-16 20:30] <dob1_> what I am saying is, if in Makefile or whatever build is defined, is setup to "give me the default gcc for this kernel" and this gcc is not installed imho is a distribution problem
[2024-01-16 20:30] <dob1_> not a package/repository problem
[2024-01-16 20:30] <dob1_> is not that virtualbox package defined gcc-12 hardcoded to use it while building the module
[2024-01-16 20:30] <pragmaticenigma> You are using an unsupported repository with a dependency requirement that is not met by Ubuntu's default and supported repository. That is not a supportable scenario here
[2024-01-16 20:32] <dob1_> ok got it, I will not insist, thanks anyway
[2024-01-16 20:41] <jwash> dob1_ I use oracle's repo for Virtualbox. Use a binary, they install fine.
[2024-01-16 20:42] <jwash> you don't need to compile it
[2024-01-16 20:54] <pragmaticenigma> !ppa | just a FYI jwash
[2024-01-16 20:54] <ubottu> just a FYI jwash: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA? See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas - WARNING: PPAs are unsupported third-party packages, and you use them at your own risk. See also !addppa and !ppa-purge
[2024-01-16 20:56] <jwash> --.
[2024-01-16 20:57] <jwash> pragmaticenigma i don't need that info
[2024-01-16 20:58] <pragmaticenigma> jwash: as the info stated... PPA are unsupported... this channel works to only suggest supported options for users. that's why that is included in that message.
[2024-01-16 20:58] <jwash> so what
[2024-01-16 20:58] <jwash> i just commented about my experience
[2024-01-16 20:58] <jwash> get over yourself
[2024-01-16 20:59] <pragmaticenigma> because then someone goes off and installs PPAs thinking becuase it was suggested or mentioned here it's a supported action. Then their install is broken and they're told "Sorry, we don't support that here" and left to pound sand. Leaving a poor experience for that person.
[2024-01-16 21:01] <jwash> i never said install a ppa, i said use a binary from the repo
[2024-01-16 21:02] <jwash> i said "I use oracle's repo for Virtualbox. Use a binary, they install fine."
[2024-01-16 21:02] <jwash> not that i use a PPA
[2024-01-16 21:02] <jwash> i just get the DEB and install it
[2024-01-16 21:10] <arraybolt3> dob1_, jwash, pragmaticenigma: For the record this happens even with the official VirtualBox from the Jammy repository.
[2024-01-16 21:10] <arraybolt3> (the GCC-12 error)
[2024-01-16 21:10] <arraybolt3> if the HWE kernel is installed in the guest.
[2024-01-16 21:10] <arraybolt3> at least that happens when installing guest additions
[2024-01-16 21:11] <arraybolt3> however Virtual
[2024-01-16 21:11] <arraybolt3> Box itself installs on a host just fine.
[2024-01-16 21:11] <jwash> it never affects me, i use the binary
[2024-01-16 21:34] <UndrWater_> new to ubuntu server: when upgrading php, is there an automated way to update modified php files, such as .ini and www?
[2024-01-16 21:35] <leftyfb> ansible
[2024-01-16 21:35] <pragmaticenigma> UndrWater_: Explain upgrading php? Like from a system update using apt?
[2024-01-16 21:37] <UndrWater_> pragmaticenigma: moving from php8.1 to php8.2 for example
[2024-01-16 21:37] <UndrWater_> perhaps migrating was a more accurate term
[2024-01-16 21:38] <pragmaticenigma> UndrWater_: it might be, as upgrade would be something handled by the package manager, which would take care of config files for you, or alert you to changes made from the package copy compared to your local copy
[2024-01-16 21:38] <leftyfb> UndrWater_: not as part of the package upgrade/install. It would be done after the package upgraded/installed.
[2024-01-16 21:39] <mtc> having trouble with my login after an upgrade... I get a black screen with a cursor instead of a login screen... I tried to boot to an old kernel with grub, but still getting the same problem... I think it is graphical driver problem.. I am using the open source amd drivers... how can I troubleshoot or reinstall them?

[2024-01-17 04:04] <aiena> why is this happening on ubuntu 22.04
[2024-01-17 04:08] <aiena> hmm actually it looks like it'
[2024-01-17 04:08] <aiena> s just some processing lag
[2024-01-17 04:09] <kotgc> Hello, I would like some help with how to mount with the correct command and location please?
[2024-01-17 04:10] <kotgc> https://dpaste.com/GE9TWVSTR
[2024-01-17 04:10] <rbox> mount what
[2024-01-17 04:11] <kotgc> My disk to be backed up is /dev/sda. I just reconnected a storage disk to store the backup in /dev/sdb. I'm running on the LiveUSB /dev/sdc.
[2024-01-17 04:12] <kotgc> So, unsure if I need to mount /dev/sda or /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 to backup the whold Ubuntu 22.04.3 OS (or whatever's needed for a recovery).
[2024-01-17 04:13] <aiena> kotgc, that rsync command loks like it is syncing the live OS's root to the backup disk
[2024-01-17 04:13] <kotgc> I'm unsure where to mount to, as I've been mounting /dev/sda2 to /mnt, but now I think I need all of /dev/sda...and how to I mount 2 disks to /mnt or to whatever location is needed?
[2024-01-17 04:13] <aiena> which is pointless
[2024-01-17 04:13] <aiena> so what you need to do make 2 dirs /mnt/srcdisk and /mnt/backupdisk
[2024-01-17 04:13] <kotgc> aiena I'm not sure, I just copied the command from https://ostechnix.com/backup-entire-linux-system-using-rsync/#google_vignette:
[2024-01-17 04:14] <kotgc> That would be my next step to figure out the rsync command.
[2024-01-17 04:14] <aiena> hmm copying something without understanding it is silly
[2024-01-17 04:14] <kotgc> I haven't crossed that bridge yet...need to figure out the mount I think?
[2024-01-17 04:14] <aiena> why dont you take two folders and test what that rsync command is doing first
[2024-01-17 04:15] <aiena> then when your confident about it backup your real disks
[2024-01-17 04:15] <kotgc> aiena copying is fine, it's applying by hitting Enter that is silly...I'm about to work on that command with a bit of lateral thinking.
[2024-01-17 04:15] <aiena> this is simply because root and home maybe be on one partition or 2 partitions inth source disk also you may have more mount points elswhere
[2024-01-17 04:15] <kotgc> rsync is step2 in my process.
[2024-01-17 04:15] <kotgc> mount is step1.
[2024-01-17 04:15] <aiena> mount isn't even step 1
[2024-01-17 04:16] <kotgc> ok, what is step 1?
[2024-01-17 04:16] <aiena> step 1 is mount the partitions and see what they contain
[2024-01-17 04:16] <aiena> then make a plan
[2024-01-17 04:16] <aiena> then unmount and remount what is needed to correct locations
[2024-01-17 04:16] <aiena> then rsync from source to destination
[2024-01-17 04:16] <aiena> So quenstion 1
[2024-01-17 04:16] <kotgc> aiena ok, I've kind of done that already. /dev/sda2 is the root and /dev/sda1 is the efi, as per fdisk -l in the dpaste.
[2024-01-17 04:17] <aiena> do you have a separate /home?
[2024-01-17 04:17] <aiena> no it looks like /home and root are 1
[2024-01-17 04:17] <kotgc> aiena I'm not clear what you mean about a separate /home?
[2024-01-17 04:17] <aiena> you only have /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2
[2024-01-17 04:17] <kotgc> dev/sda is a default Ubuntu 22.04.3 install.
[2024-01-17 04:18] <aiena> so I assume that /dev/sda2 has everything include your user account data
[2024-01-17 04:18] <aiena> yes that makes sense
[2024-01-17 04:18] <kotgc> aiena yes, and /dev/sda1 is the efi thingy.
[2024-01-17 04:18] <aiena> unles you do manual partitioning ubuntu puts everything in 1 partition (except the efi one of course)
[2024-01-17 04:18] <kotgc> ok, it's all default.
[2024-01-17 04:18] <aiena> from your output it seems you chose the utomatic install
[2024-01-17 04:18] <aiena> yes correct
[2024-01-17 04:19] <aiena> ok so for now you do umount /mnt
[2024-01-17 04:19] <aiena> this will unmount /dev/sdb1
[2024-01-17 04:19] <aiena> is sdb1 empty or does it have data?
[2024-01-17 04:19] <aiena> the backup drive
[2024-01-17 04:19] <kotgc> dev/sb1 has the efi thingy
[2024-01-17 04:20] <aiena> from your output /dev/sdb1   2048 234440703 234438656 111.8G Linux filesystem
[2024-01-17 04:21] <aiena> so it looks like just one partition is there no efi partition which should be formatted as FA3T2
[2024-01-17 04:21] <aiena> have you already unountd /dev/sdb1 or is it still mounted?
[2024-01-17 04:21] <aiena> unmounted
[2024-01-17 04:21] <kotgc> dev/sdb1 is the SSD120 to receive the backup of dev/sda
[2024-01-17 04:22] <aiena> ok fine now next question
[2024-01-17 04:22] <kotgc> I just booted the LiveUSB and pasted the code here https://dpaste.com/GE9TWVSTR
[2024-01-17 04:22] <aiena> do you want your backup ssd to also be bootable in the event of a disaster
[2024-01-17 04:22] <kotgc> ok, so nothing mounted or unmounted, just default.
[2024-01-17 04:22] <aiena> or is it just for data only and you dont care about reinstalling the OS
[2024-01-17 04:23] <kotgc> aiena I just need access to the backup if /dev/sda is destroyed in the next project of trying to fix /dev/sda.
[2024-01-17 04:23] <kotgc> *if
[2024-01-17 04:23] <kotgc> ignore above *if
[2024-01-17 04:23] <aiena> in that case it's better to backup both the efi partition and the root partition
[2024-01-17 04:24] <aiena> so that would mean even before mounting the first step would be to repartition the backup disk
[2024-01-17 04:24] <aiena> in your live boot there is a program called gparted most likely
[2024-01-17 04:26] <kotgc> aiena ok, one more thing, how can I check I connected the correct storage disk? I don't want to overwrite some data I had on one of the storage disks?
[2024-01-17 04:27] <aiena> multiple ways
[2024-01-17 04:27] <aiena> you can type the command
[2024-01-17 04:27] <aiena> lsblk
[2024-01-17 04:27] <aiena> it will list available drives and partition ignore the /dev/loop ones
[2024-01-17 04:28] <aiena> all the loop ones ignore if present
[2024-01-17 04:28] <aiena> you may see things like sda sdb nvme
[2024-01-17 04:28] <aiena> those are physical drives/ssd's
[2024-01-17 04:28] <aiena> you will also see the total size of each
[2024-01-17 04:28] <kotgc> https://dpaste.com/G3V46K35V doesn't show me if there's data on it though?
[2024-01-17 04:28] <aiena> right
[2024-01-17 04:29] <aiena> so sdb1 is showing 110gb
[2024-01-17 04:29] <aiena> err sdb
[2024-01-17 04:29] <kotgc> I thought I might be able to navigate through its directories?
[2024-01-17 04:29] <aiena> and sda is showing 223GB
[2024-01-17 04:29] <kotgc> Yes, /dev/sdb is 120GB SSD.
[2024-01-17 04:29] <kotgc> So, probably no data.
[2024-01-17 04:30] <aiena> so from the disk size are you able to confirm sdb is backup and sda is inside based on total size
[2024-01-17 04:30] <aiena> ok this will not tell you if you have data or no data
[2024-01-17 04:30] <kotgc> I'm not confident that shows there's no data though?
[2024-01-17 04:30] <aiena> but it will help you get an idea of which is what
[2024-01-17 04:30] <aiena> for example /dev/sdc is 14GB so it definetly looks like a pen drive or your live boot
[2024-01-17 04:30] <kotgc> dev/sdb is the storage disk. dev/sda is the OS to be backed up.
[2024-01-17 04:30] <aiena> yes ok so that is clear
[2024-01-17 04:31] <aiena> now for your second question
[2024-01-17 04:31] <aiena> from lsblk output you can see that /dev/sdb1 is mounted in /mnt location
[2024-01-17 04:31] <aiena> so now type
[2024-01-17 04:31] <aiena> ls -la /mnt
[2024-01-17 04:31] <kotgc> Q2: any data on /dev/sdb.
[2024-01-17 04:31] <aiena> see if you get any output
[2024-01-17 04:32] <kotgc> https://dpaste.com/AZCWJ4Y2L
[2024-01-17 04:32] <aiena> ok it looks like it is empty
[2024-01-17 04:33] <aiena> also can you paste the output of
[2024-01-17 04:33] <kotgc> 1 of the 3 storage disks has about 80GB, so this dev/sdb must be empty.
[2024-01-17 04:33] <aiena> mount |grep /mnt
[2024-01-17 04:34] <kotgc> https://dpaste.com/GRNL77SX4
[2024-01-17 04:34] <aiena> just to determine the filesystem
[2024-01-17 04:34] <aiena> ok so it looks like a linux file system too
[2024-01-17 04:34] <aiena> ok now step 3
[2024-01-17 04:35] <aiena> Oh no I have to go I am sorry
[2024-01-17 04:36] <aiena> step 3 is to mount /dev/sda1 to a folder in  some other path and then type du -h /newpath
[2024-01-17 04:37] <aiena> to see how space is utilised of sda and if it will fit in sdb
[2024-01-17 04:37] <kotgc> ok
[2024-01-17 04:38] <kotgc> looking up command for moun
[2024-01-17 04:38] <kotgc> *mount
[2024-01-17 04:39] <kotgc> Done with command:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 Documents/
[2024-01-17 04:40] <kotgc> https://dpaste.com/2W74U8YCW
[2024-01-17 04:41] <plujon> The past 2 days, my computer has not awakened from suspend when I pressed a key.
[2024-01-17 04:42] <plujon> I had to hard reboot it both times.
[2024-01-17 04:43] <plujon> Is there something I can do to enable extra logging before suspending to figure out the cause?
[2024-01-17 04:43] <aiena>  sudo umount /dev/sda1 Documents/ &&  sudo mount /dev/sda2 Documents/  && sudo du -h Documents/
[2024-01-17 04:43] <aiena> what is the output
[2024-01-17 04:44] <kotgc> aiena https://dpaste.com/F6N89U386
[2024-01-17 04:44] <aiena> if it is more than external disk all data will not fit in external backup disk
[2024-01-17 04:45] <aiena> ok
[2024-01-17 04:45] <aiena> actually drive was busy
[2024-01-17 04:45] <aiena> so do
[2024-01-17 04:46] <aiena> cd .. && sudo umount /dev/sda1 &&  sudo mount /dev/sda2 Documents/  && sudo du -h Documents/
[2024-01-17 04:46] <kotgc> maybe because I already mount it? https://dpaste.com/2W74U8YCW
[2024-01-17 04:46] <aiena> no you moutned efi partition my bad so i wanted to see rgualr partition usage
[2024-01-17 04:46] <aiena> try above cmd
[2024-01-17 04:47] <aiena> will be afk for 40 mins or so
[2024-01-17 04:47] <kotgc> aiena https://dpaste.com/7MJ7MTM6T
[2024-01-17 04:47] <kotgc> ok
[2024-01-17 05:22] <BlueSmoke> Hi, Using ububtu20.04 on a laptop!  Left shift Key not working with i or L and a few others. Right shift works as normal
[2024-01-17 05:22] <BlueSmoke> can anyone point me in the right direction to work out whats wrong?
[2024-01-17 05:22] <BlueSmoke> If it helps it acts the same if I change en or us
[2024-01-17 05:23] <rbox> thats funny, i had the exact same problem with a work laptop
[2024-01-17 05:23] <rbox> they just gave me a new one
[2024-01-17 05:23] <rbox> haha
[2024-01-17 05:23] <BlueSmoke> maybe it was something in an upgrade It was working before
[2024-01-17 05:24] <BlueSmoke> don't think I have changed anything
[2024-01-17 05:26] <BlueSmoke> In  /etc/default/keyboard
[2024-01-17 05:26] <BlueSmoke> it says
[2024-01-17 05:26] <BlueSmoke> XKBLAYOUT=gb,us
[2024-01-17 05:26] <BlueSmoke> BACKSPACE=guess
[2024-01-17 05:26] <BlueSmoke> XKBVARIANT=,
[2024-01-17 05:27] <BlueSmoke> Not sure if thats normal
[2024-01-17 05:39] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Not normal - have a read ' man 5 keyboard '// is the comma present in the config file ?
[2024-01-17 05:39] <BlueSmoke> yes thats exactly whats in there
[2024-01-17 05:40] <BlueSmoke> just the 3 lines
[2024-01-17 05:41] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Is your keyboard a US ascii 105 keys board ? // a comma in the file does not look to be posit.
[2024-01-17 05:43] <BlueSmoke> its a uk layout laptop with shared num pad
[2024-01-17 05:45] <BlueSmoke> oppsÂ  its i and k and some others L does work
[2024-01-17 05:59] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: I do not know enough about a keyboard layout to have an exact opinion. but see too: man xkeyboard-config / Can get "complex". However, one can reset the mapping.
[2024-01-17 06:01] <BlueSmoke> Thanks! It's a start as looking for posts was confusing with so many different problems listed, I didn't know what one was the same as mine
[2024-01-17 06:04] <BlueSmoke> I saw stuff about remappin and all that but I did't want to complicate it it worked as standard before so I wanted to try to keep it to standard if possible
[2024-01-17 06:05] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: If you run out of patience, an no other offers a solution >> ' sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration ' will allow you to choose what layout to reset.
[2024-01-17 06:06] <BlueSmoke> great thanks I was worried about messing with it too much in case it became unusable so that will help if I mess it up thanks
[2024-01-17 06:17] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: I stand corrected - I have in my notes: XKBVARIANT="," // Maybe a fix for your currrent file ?
[2024-01-17 06:18] <BlueSmoke> I was trying to take out the , and save but it says its read only
[2024-01-17 06:21] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: "ls -al /etc/default/keyboard" >> "-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 150 Aug 26  2022 /etc/default/keyboard " // root owned filke - will require "sudo" access to edit.
[2024-01-17 06:23] <BlueSmoke> I tried cd /etc/default
[2024-01-17 06:23] <BlueSmoke> ls and kebored was there I tried sudo edit and it came up I removed the , but didnt know how to save it
[2024-01-17 06:24] <BlueSmoke> thats what I tried beore your lat post
[2024-01-17 06:26] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: I excpect the editor here to be "nano" --  save == Ctrl + O. exit nano by pressing Ctrl + X.
[2024-01-17 06:28] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Lower case o and x :(
[2024-01-17 06:31] <BlueSmoke> I must be doing somting wron its not letting me type in it
[2024-01-17 06:32] <BlueSmoke> it has a warning that a swap file owns it
[2024-01-17 06:36] <BlueSmoke> apparently its vim
[2024-01-17 06:36] <BlueSmoke> and not responding much probably just dont know what I'm doing
[2024-01-17 06:38] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Sorry again - never had the need to want to use vim :(
[2024-01-17 06:39] <BlueSmoke> E325: ATTENTION
[2024-01-17 06:39] <BlueSmoke> Found a swap file by the name "/etc/default/.keyboard.swp"

[2024-01-17 06:39] <BlueSmoke> Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  modified: YES
[2024-01-17 06:39] <BlueSmoke> I tried touch before it didnt do anything
[2024-01-17 06:39] <BlueSmoke> thought that was an editor too
[2024-01-17 06:40] <BlueSmoke> can I edit from the gui edit
[2024-01-17 06:41] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: If you type /etc/default/keyboard and hit the enter key, does that work ?
[2024-01-17 06:43] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: I wont be much help on your GUI as I have only used xfce for years.
[2024-01-17 06:44] <BlueSmoke> from just pasting that into the terminal
[2024-01-17 06:45] <BlueSmoke> etc/default/keyboard: Permission denied
[2024-01-17 06:49] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: lemme see what DDG says about saving in vim.
[2024-01-17 06:49] <BlueSmoke> ok I did it by typing nanoÂ  but it said vim has it open I think it crashed but I edited it anyway and on reading it back its changed
[2024-01-17 06:49] <BlueSmoke> I added the ","
[2024-01-17 06:51] <BlueSmoke> so now I would have to make it restart the keybord thing it said in one of the links you sent
[2024-01-17 06:53] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Yeah - restart so the change takes effect - easiest is to just reboot.
[2024-01-17 06:53] <BlueSmoke> udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=change
[2024-01-17 06:53] <BlueSmoke> Â In order to activate the changes on the console, run setupcon(1).
[2024-01-17 06:53] <BlueSmoke> do I do them both
[2024-01-17 06:54] <Bashing-om> reboot should be fine.
[2024-01-17 06:54] <BlueSmoke> fromÂ  that man 5 keyboard
[2024-01-17 06:55] <BlueSmoke> if I crash the browser it should reconect on restor ok I'll restart
[2024-01-17 07:00] <BlueSmoke> It didnt fix it let me check in it kept the changes
[2024-01-17 07:02] <BlueSmoke> yes the BlueSmoke,@ is there now but still iff i type kkkk its working and shift k gives nothing and right shift gives KKKK
[2024-01-17 07:05] <BlueSmoke> "," is there now I meant
[2024-01-17 07:06] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Back where we were last night - out of my knowledge range :(
[2024-01-17 07:07] <BlueSmoke> unfortunatly I was hoping a new crowd of ppl might be on
[2024-01-17 07:08] <BlueSmoke> whats about that restore one you said about it wont help find out what it is but might fix it
[2024-01-17 07:10] <BlueSmoke> or try it without the , or the ","
[2024-01-17 07:10] <BlueSmoke> not sure whats in there as standard
[2024-01-17 07:11] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Keep youe witts about you and run ' sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration ' .
[2024-01-17 07:13] <BlueSmoke> ok I'll give it a go
[2024-01-17 07:14] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Keep notes on what you choose :)
[2024-01-17 07:15] <BlueSmoke> is there some otion to reset it to default ?
[2024-01-17 07:18] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Best I recall - a menu to change/reset the layout you want.
[2024-01-17 07:20] <BlueSmoke> so far its asking me what keyboard its just in an older laptop not listed
[2024-01-17 07:20] <BlueSmoke> is there a way to save the jurent settings first in case I want to revert it back
[2024-01-17 07:23] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Not that I am aware of :(
[2024-01-17 07:24] <BlueSmoke> might just put it to generic 105 pc kb
[2024-01-17 07:25] <BlueSmoke> or theres a 101 not sure I want to count all the key lol
[2024-01-17 07:25] <BlueSmoke> keys
[2024-01-17 07:26] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Like I said last night - I do not know how to determine the keyboard :(
[2024-01-17 07:27] <BlueSmoke> Well you are the only on that has answered so Its cool we got this far and tried one option
[2024-01-17 07:29] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: localectl status !
[2024-01-17 07:30] <BlueSmoke> Â  Â System Locale: LANG=en_GB.UTF-8

[2024-01-17 07:30] <BlueSmoke> Â  Â  Â X11 Variant: ,
[2024-01-17 07:32] <BlueSmoke> might try removing that , fist
[2024-01-17 07:32] <BlueSmoke> first
[2024-01-17 07:34] <BlueSmoke> ok I'll reset
[2024-01-17 07:37] <cbus> is there any way to disable the update notifications for ubuntu pro in the "Software Updater"?
[2024-01-17 07:40] <BlueSmoke> no different
[2024-01-17 07:42] <BlueSmoke> looks likw only 87 keys if I counted right but then it might count the alternatives on the num pad and stuff
[2024-01-17 07:46] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: My layout "X11 Model: pc105" 105 keys including the number pad.
[2024-01-17 07:56] <BlueSmoke> So far te same
[2024-01-17 08:02] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Any joy ' setxkbmap -query ' to know the keyboard ? mine >> model:      pc105 .
[2024-01-17 08:02] <BlueSmoke> I changed it to 105 now still not working
[2024-01-17 08:05] <BlueSmoke> its strange it dont give any output for that k key when left shift is held
[2024-01-17 08:13] <Bashing-om> BlueSmoke: Yeah - A real wierd one.
[2024-01-17 08:14] <BlueSmoke> its the i k and a few others inc some Fkeys

[2024-01-17 08:26] <olspookishmagus> rtl8188eus
[2024-01-17 08:26] <olspookishmagus> is there any other way than the fully manual way to install this driver to ubuntu?
[2024-01-17 08:32] <Bluewolf> Good day. I'm using Ubuntu 22.04, with a dual boot with Win10. Upon boot-up, after the boot menu, loading into linux, my system gets stuck with a few errors. It takes a couple restarts before getting to the log in screen and then everything's fine. Is there a command I can run to show what the problem is from the terminal?
[2024-01-17 08:33] <osse> Is there a significance to the mic icon being orange instead of the same color as the rest? https://imgur.com/a/9HTzAI4
[2024-01-17 08:36] <Bashing-om> Bluewolf: Might try 'journalctl -b -0 ' shows messages from the current boot, ' journalctl -b -1 ' from the previous boot.

[2024-01-17 08:40] <Bluewolf> <Bashing-om> Thanks. Let me run them. If I paste the output, would you mind going through it?
[2024-01-17 08:44] <Bashing-om> Bluewolf: It is 2:42 in the AM here --- long past bed time for me --- I am struggling to stay awake -- about to go away - sure others here can lend assistance.
[2024-01-17 08:45] <Bluewolf> <Bashing-om> Understandable, thank you thus far. Have a good morning.
[2024-01-17 08:46] <Bashing-om> Bluewolf: :D Gone
[2024-01-17 08:48] <Bluewolf> This is the output to my question above, what is the problem and how would I go about fixing it? https://dpaste.com/E8A39AYDS  -  https://dpaste.com/AC9ETSKYJ
[2024-01-17 10:36] <morpheuz> Im currently running neon stable (plasma 5). but i need to switch hardware. Should i keep my old install(just swap it into the new machine) or should i switch to (plasma 6) release candidate? Or is it better to make a fresh install of current stable neon(plasma)?
[2024-01-17 10:38] <ravage> We only support official flavors of Ubuntu hereÂ
[2024-01-17 10:39] <morpheuz> ravage i know, but my question is more of a general linux question. When switching hardware, should i keep my old install or always make a fresh install? the flavor of ubuntu/linux doesn't matter that much imo.
[2024-01-17 10:40] <ravage> You should install a fresh version of a version that is supported here
[2024-01-17 10:40] <ravage> If you plan to get support for it hereÂ
[2024-01-17 11:20] <BlackNoir> Hi can anyone help me fix brightness issue? I cannot make the brightness up my screen is too dimmed. I'm using 23.10 version
[2024-01-17 11:21] <ravage> it may be related to your nickname. sorry. bad joke. moving on.
[2024-01-17 11:22] <BlackNoir> It only became like this after there's a little update with the system.
[2024-01-17 11:23] <BlackNoir> the issue is I can do the minimum brightness but when I'm trying to increase the brightness it's like it only increase by 1-10% brightness
[2024-01-17 11:56] <Bluewolf> Anyone able to take a look at these errors upon boot, tell me what the issue is and how to fix it? https://dpaste.com/E8A39AYDS  -  https://dpaste.com/AC9ETSKYJ
[2024-01-17 11:59] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: there are a few current bugs booting on kernel 6.5, could you try a previous kernel version as a test?
[2024-01-17 12:00] <Bluewolf> <lotuspsychje> I don't know how to go about doing that. Why does it not boot up but after a hard reset it loads up fine?
[2024-01-17 12:01] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: hold shift to enter grub at post boot, then pick a previous kernel from there
[2024-01-17 12:04] <Bluewolf> <lotuspsychje> Okay thanks. Is that the only likely error to cause failed boot up that's on that list?
[2024-01-17 12:05] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: im not sure whats your issue yet, at this stage we are still testing
[2024-01-17 12:06] <Bluewolf> <lotuspsychje> Okay. I'm currently on the machine in question and its quite a pain to get back in after rebooting.
[2024-01-17 12:07] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: you should always be able to enter grub or recoverymode
[2024-01-17 12:07] <lotuspsychje> from there you can run some admin tasks
[2024-01-17 12:08] <Bluewolf> I have a dual boot and the option to load into recovery mode is there. I'm just really out of touch with doing it all :(
[2024-01-17 12:19] <lotuspsychje> !recovery | Bluewolf
[2024-01-17 12:19] <ubottu> Bluewolf: If your system fails to boot normally, it may be useful to boot it into recovery mode. For instructions, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode
[2024-01-17 12:20] <Bluewolf> Thanks friend :y:
[2024-01-17 12:22] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: from there you can pick 2 roads, boot a previous kernel or drop to a recovermode menu to do some admin tasks
[2024-01-17 12:22] <Bluewolf> <lotuspsychje> What do these admin task entail?
[2024-01-17 12:24] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: you can drop to a rootshell, enable networking, load failsafe graphics etc
[2024-01-17 12:25] <Bluewolf> <lotuspsychje> Alright. Will start with grub, then recovery mode.
[2024-01-17 12:27] <lotuspsychje> Bluewolf: for your case, i would try to boot a previous kernel as a test first
[2024-01-17 12:28] <Bluewolf> Yes, sorry that's what I meant by grub.
[2024-01-17 13:54] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-17 16:05] <yashwanth> hi
[2024-01-17 16:05] <yashwanth> hi
[2024-01-17 17:36] <telgareith> Is there a version of Ubuntu that has openZFS 2.2.2? Instead of the majorly flawed 2.0.0?
[2024-01-17 17:36] <leftyfb> !info openzfs
[2024-01-17 17:36] <ubottu> Package openzfs does not exist in mantic
[2024-01-17 17:37] <leftyfb> wouldn't that be built into the kernel?
[2024-01-17 17:37] <telgareith> Kernel driver, and userland tools
[2024-01-17 17:38] <leftyfb> !info | libzfs4linux
[2024-01-17 17:38] <ubottu> 'libzfs4linux' is not a valid release
[2024-01-17 17:38] <leftyfb> !info libzfs4linux
[2024-01-17 17:38] <ubottu> libzfs4linux (2.2.0-0ubuntu1~23.10, mantic): OpenZFS filesystem library for Linux - general support. In component main, is optional. Built by zfs-linux. Size 219 kB / 650 kB. (Only available for linux-any.)
[2024-01-17 17:39] <telgareith> I'm not compiling it unless I can do so with the build environment Ubuntu uses, just with 2.2.2 source
[2024-01-17 17:39] <leftyfb> telgareith: pretty sure libzfs4linux version 2.0.x isn't available on any supported releases of ubuntu
[2024-01-17 18:09] <sem> Good morning. I have an old PC that currently runs Lubuntu 20.04 LTS. How do I "convert" this system to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with LXQt so that it can continue to be community-supported?
[2024-01-17 18:11] <sem> Unfortunately I cannot upgrade to Lubuntu 22.04 because my graphics card is not supported in nouveau, and the nvidia-340 driver is EOL and supports Linux 5.4 at the latest
[2024-01-17 18:12] <arraybolt3> sem: You don't need to do anything, once the Lubuntu team stops supporting a release, the community support provided by the underlying Ubuntu LTS continues.
[2024-01-17 18:13] <sem> Ok, thanks arraybolt3 for your help with this :)
[2024-01-17 18:14] <arraybolt3> Glad to help :)
[2024-01-17 19:06] <ericus> I need help. Remmina to Windows machine used to work. Now only remote sound from Windows works, not microphone
[2024-01-17 20:52] <ambrosesays> heey, does anyone know a way to format an sdcard?
[2024-01-17 21:33] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm using ubuntu 22.04. After a reboot, I cannot connect to the internet via wireless. I think my computer has wifi capability on the motherboard itself - but I'm not sure
[2024-01-17 21:34] <bobdobbs> I've managed to reconnect by running a cable directly to my rig
[2024-01-17 21:35] <bobdobbs> I can't seem to find wifi setting form the gnome desktop panel
[2024-01-17 21:39] <erry_> la quattordicesima
[2024-01-17 21:42] <Nomikos> no, il diciassette
[2024-01-17 21:42] <erry_> :-)
[2024-01-17 22:42] <sem> bobdobbs: are you still having problems?
[2024-01-17 22:50] <loswedseded> on a terminal, what key or combination do I have to press to stop a program? say, ytb-dl
[2024-01-17 22:51] <loswedseded> I tried ctrl+c, ctrl+q but they don't work
[2024-01-17 22:51] <loswedseded> I believe a combination of those keys shut all my open terminals...
[2024-01-17 22:51] <arraybolt3> Ctrl+C is supposed to work
[2024-01-17 22:51] <arraybolt3> Ctrl+\ sometimes works better
[2024-01-17 22:51] <arraybolt3> (it's more "nuclear" than Ctrl+C)
[2024-01-17 22:52] <arraybolt3> If those don't work, you'll have to SIGTERM the process, and if that doesn't work SIGKILL it.
[2024-01-17 22:53] <sarnold> ^Q will ask the terminal to stop output. it'll look like the thing is dead. ^S will restart terminal output.
[2024-01-17 22:53] <sarnold> ^Z will suspend the process
[2024-01-17 22:54] <sarnold> the process can block the ^Z; it can probably reconfigure ^Q and ^S, too, to make those not do anything
[2024-01-17 23:51] <sem> I plugged an ethernet cord into one of those powered "ethernet to USB-c adapters" into my laptop
[2024-01-17 23:51] <sem> I can see the ethernet lights blinking, however nm-applet shows "ethernet unplugged" and ip link shows "down"
[2024-01-17 23:51] <sem> I am not sure how to begin troubleshooting this
[2024-01-17 23:52] <sarnold> if it were me, I'd check lsusb or lspci output to see if I could find the chipset, then try to use that to figure out what module to load, if any, and then load that module or build that module or pay someone to write a module to support it, etc
[2024-01-17 23:53] <sem> hmm so it is likely not supported at the hardware level?
[2024-01-17 23:54] <EriC^^> sem: try 'lsusb' does it mention it?
[2024-01-17 23:54] <JanC> you should be able to check if it is supported
[2024-01-17 23:54] <sem> Yeah, ID 0b95:1790 ASIX Electronics Corp. AX88179 Gigabit Ethernet
[2024-01-17 23:54] <EriC^^> sem: what about 'lshw -c network' ? any driver loaded?
[2024-01-17 23:56] <sem> EriC^^, Yes I see something in there with logical name enxf8...
[2024-01-17 23:56] <sem> oh and now ethernet is working in network manager... :)
[2024-01-17 23:56] <sem> you fixed it
[2024-01-17 23:56] <JanC> heh
[2024-01-17 23:57] <sem> thanks a bunch -- and that is a good tip for investigating the hw to see if it is supported
[2024-01-17 23:58] <sarnold> oh yay :)
[2024-01-17 23:58] <JanC> also, you said 'ip link' showed it as "down", so that already meant it had a driver loaded
[2024-01-17 23:59] <JanC> it could still have been the wrong driver or a broken driver
[2024-01-18 00:00] <sem> yeah; let me read the terminal scrollup bc I think it had a different device name
[2024-01-18 00:01] <sem> no it is the same one, not sure why it took a while to go from down to up but I'll have to remember that for next time
[2024-01-18 00:01] <JanC> no, I think it was just still busy setting up a connection or something like that
[2024-01-18 00:02] <JanC> the ethernet chip inside that usb thing would have to "boot" after you plug it in too, no idea how long that takes  :)
[2024-01-18 00:03] <JanC> or maybe upload a firmware to it
[2024-01-18 00:33] <ghil> Hello there! Quick question: I've been trying to install 23.10, and it doesn't see my NVME at all. I've installed Ubuntu numerous times in the past and it always worked fine. Would the best course of action be to install the LTS and then update?
[2024-01-18 00:35] <tomreyn> ghil: it's probably some setting in your bios which prevents ubuntu from seeing it.
[2024-01-18 00:36] <tomreyn> disable 'Intel RST' or 'RAID' configurations
[2024-01-18 00:38] <ghil> Yeah I thought so too that I had reactivated something since last time but it's not time. It kind of sees it, but only as manual partitioning, and doesn't work even then. Fedora installed fine on it (am running currently on that). The NVME is in AHCPI or something like that, and secure boot is off.
[2024-01-18 00:40] <tomreyn> i should say that "it doesn't see my NVME at all" != "it kind of sees it, but only as manual partitioning"
[2024-01-18 00:40] <Guest74> Hi! I am struggling to find A4-4300M with Radeon HD 7420G drivers for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS OS. Is it true that the only solution to remove/solve this error from the boot screen is to downgrade Ubuntu to 15.04 as this is the latest one which officially supports the A4-4300M with Radeon HD 7420G according to
[2024-01-18 00:40] <Guest74> https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-lin-15-9 ?
[2024-01-18 00:40] <tomreyn> if fedora installed fine on it with the same bios settings, then, yes, try the LTS
[2024-01-18 00:40] <ghil> Sorry, am a bit confounded at the problem. it sometimes barely sees it, and can't really interact with it (You can erase the partitions, but then the disk disappear
[2024-01-18 00:41] <ghil> Will I be able to update the LTS to 23.10?
[2024-01-18 00:42] <sarnold> ghil: yeah, you ought to be able to upgrade, I think there's a file to edit to allow that LTS -> non-LTS transition
[2024-01-18 00:42] <ghil> That makes sense. I'll try that. Nothing against Fedora, but I really want to see where Ubuntu as gone since I last used it a couple of years ago.
[2024-01-18 00:43] <tomreyn> Guest74: you shouldn't need drivers. try just installing ubuntu, it should work out of the box.
[2024-01-18 00:44] <sarnold> ghil: I think /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades is the file you'd need to poke to allow the upgrade
[2024-01-18 00:44] <Guest74> tomreyn: a black screen during every boot includes a message "_common_interrupt: 1.55 No irq handler for vector" and ACPI errors appear
[2024-01-18 00:45] <tomreyn> Guest74: does it still finish booting, though?
[2024-01-18 00:46] <ghil> @sarnold thanks! I'll look that up on the otherside of the install :)
[2024-01-18 00:47] <xangua> Guest74: I have those "errors" too, AMD A4, on Ubuntu, Debian, any distro. No issues using the computer.
[2024-01-18 00:47] <Guest74> tomreyn: yes, I can use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS normally but I am trying to find a way to solve/remove all messages appearing during the boot
[2024-01-18 00:47] <sarnold> ghil: once you've got it installed, install all the updates, edit that file, and then do-release-upgrade -- I think that's about all it'll take
[2024-01-18 00:48] <sarnold> Guest74: you might be able to get some of them to go away by fiddling with BIOS settings; others of them could only go away by convincing your BIOS vendor to provide updates for things
[2024-01-18 00:48] <sem> I also have those no irq handler for vector errors
[2024-01-18 00:48] <sem> but i boot ok
[2024-01-18 00:49] <sem> The other way I've seen of getting those errors to go away involves sending them to a different virtual terminal, but then you won't see real errors either...
[2024-01-18 00:51] <tomreyn> Guest74: according to https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg2415577.html this is an AMD AGESA BIOS bug. I.e. a portionof the BIOS that AMD manages and needs to provide updates for to the mainboard manufacturer is buggy.
[2024-01-18 00:51] <sarnold> you can also change the loglevels of the console so that you never see them :)
[2024-01-18 00:52] <tomreyn> Guest74: a bios upgrade might help. to see which one you have:  journalctl -b | grep DMI:
[2024-01-18 00:52] <sarnold> maybe fwupd can help there
[2024-01-18 00:52] <sarnold> but not enough vendors use it :(
[2024-01-18 00:52] <Guest74> sarnold: I have read too that changing something in BIOS helps for some people but it seems that the AMD is officially supporting Ubuntu up to 15.04 for this AMD version
[2024-01-18 00:53] <sarnold> Guest74: .. for that specific proprietary driver
[2024-01-18 00:54] <tomreyn> amd only provides limited driver support for graphics chipsets. i think this is what you are referring to. they do cooperate with linux developers, though, and this has allowed open source graphics driver support to become part of the linux kernel
[2024-01-18 00:55] <Guest74> tomreyn: I got "kernel: DMI: Hewlett-Packard HP ProBook 4545s/17ED, BIOS 68CPD Ver. F.68 03/28/2018" from your mentioned command
[2024-01-18 00:57] <Guest74> tomreyn: AMD customer care answered: "AMD release the drivers in accordance with operating system support". That means the cooperation between AMD and Ubuntu support has not been fruitful regarding Radeon HD 7420G?
[2024-01-18 00:58] <tomreyn> Guest74: you are using ubuntu 22.04 and got graphical output. that's partially a result of a fruitful cooperation of amd and linux kernel developers.
[2024-01-18 01:01] <tomreyn> Guest74: you already have the latest bios available
[2024-01-18 01:01] <tomreyn> that's according to https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-probook-4545s-notebook-pc/5229461
[2024-01-18 01:01] <tomreyn> so you might just need to live with this message, or try what sarnold suggested
[2024-01-18 01:02] <sarnold> Guest74: AMD wants you to buy new hardware. they aren't going to put a ton of effort into supporting a ten year old GPU on a brand new OS
[2024-01-18 01:03] <sarnold> Guest74: that's why they haven't supported that processor in their proprietary drivers for nine years
[2024-01-18 01:03] <Guest74> tomreyn: indeed but how to make the aforementioned errors disappear? AMD suggests to wait for official driver update but it is not published since Ubuntu 15.04 came out.
[2024-01-18 01:03] <sarnold> Guest74: luckily for you, the open source drivers are better supported :)
[2024-01-18 01:04] <Guest74> which one is better: fwupd or loglevels hiding?
[2024-01-18 01:04] <sarnold> they do different things
[2024-01-18 01:04] <sarnold> fwupd is more likely to fix problems, add new features, etc
[2024-01-18 01:04] <sarnold> loglevel hiding lets you focus on more important things in life
[2024-01-18 01:06] <tomreyn> fwupd won't help if there's no newer bios available, though
[2024-01-18 01:09] <Guest74> sarnold how to change the loglevels of the console?
[2024-01-18 01:13] <sarnold> Guest74: you'd add a new loglevel=2  or loglevel=3 or something similar parameter to your kernel command line; the kernel documentation on the setting is in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt -- you'd edit /etc/default/grub and then run update-grub and then reboot
[2024-01-18 01:18] <Guest74> sarnold: if I choose 3, then all the entries 4-7 are ignored?
[2024-01-18 01:20] <tomreyn> Guest74: yes
[2024-01-18 01:20] <Guest74> I can see "GRUB_DEFAULT=0
[2024-01-18 01:20] <Guest74> GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden

[2024-01-18 01:21] <tomreyn> the line you will need to edit is GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
[2024-01-18 01:22] <tomreyn>  add the loglevel instruction behind     atkbd.reset    and before the trailing   "
[2024-01-18 01:22] <tomreyn> then run    sudo update-grub    and reboot

[2024-01-18 01:25] <sarnold> Guest74: oh hah somehow I thought you wanted to see what mine is. nevermind :)
[2024-01-18 01:27] <Guest74> Should I worry about https://pastebin.com/2VSDm8zD ?
[2024-01-18 01:28] <tomreyn> no
[2024-01-18 01:28] <Guest74> I mean 16-bit boot, os-prober ?
[2024-01-18 01:28] <Guest74> Why it stated "Adding boot menu entry for UEFI Firmware Settings"? Is it about the line I just added to grub?
[2024-01-18 01:28] <sarnold> I uninstalled os-prober because I didn't want it cluttering up my logs all the time, but if you dual-boot it might be worth keeping it around
[2024-01-18 01:29] <sarnold> or if you *might* dual-boot ..
[2024-01-18 01:29] <sarnold> memtest eventually gets an EFI version :) so hopefully in a future release that message will go away on its own *and* it'll be useful to you again
[2024-01-18 01:30] <tomreyn> the "boot menu entry for uefi firmware settings" is where grub tells you that it has added an option to access the bios setup menu from its (grub) menu
[2024-01-18 01:30] <tomreyn> for convenience
[2024-01-18 01:31] <Guest74> Great, thank you! So much!
[2024-01-18 01:31] <jwash> hi everyone, i have a program that wants me to Alt + L click, but Ubuntu will grab the window and move it instead
[2024-01-18 01:32] <jwash> is there a way to disable grab window with Alt + L click
[2024-01-18 01:32] <sem> jwash, maybe if you go into settings and to keyboard shortcuts you can disable the alt-l shortcut
[2024-01-18 01:32] <sem> unless you tried that already
[2024-01-18 01:35] <sarnold> jwash: alt+drag has been a standard way to move windows around for a few decades; perhaps the program has a way to let you remap whatever it is doing, rather than trying to remap your window manager instead
[2024-01-18 01:36] <tomreyn> i don't think default mutter / gnome-shell have an Alt-L keyboard shortcut doing what you describe ("grab window with Alt + L click") out of the box.
[2024-01-18 01:36] <sarnold> tomreyn: not alt+l, alt + (MOUSE LEFT CLICK)
[2024-01-18 01:36] <tomreyn> oh that could be
[2024-01-18 01:37] <tomreyn> it's meta then, though
[2024-01-18 03:08] <italicizem> is there a Rhino-like distro with KDE or does Rhino support it?
[2024-01-18 03:08] <rbox> what is rhino
[2024-01-18 03:09] <rbox> rhino-like*
[2024-01-18 03:09] <jwash> tomreyn sarnold the answer was to use <windows key> + <alt> + <l mouse click>
[2024-01-18 04:16] <mojtaba> Hello, I am using Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS and I using Firefox 120.0.1 (64-bit). I noticed that in /var/log/syslog, there are lots of lines like the following which shows firefox was trying to access the zsh history file. Does anybody know why it needs to access that file and if it is legit?
[2024-01-18 04:16] <mojtaba> Jan 15 21:59:32 HOST kernel: [224076.488920] audit: type=1400 audit(1705373972.859:21753): apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" class="file" profile="snap.firefox.firefox" name="/home/USER/.zsh_history" pid=10454 comm="pool-firefox" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=1000 ouid=1000
[2024-01-18 04:23] <lunatiq> I'm getting asked to select what packages I want to install from  a gui and I don't know how to check to boxes
[2024-01-18 04:24] <lunatiq> got it
[2024-01-18 04:43] <arraybolt3> mojtaba: that's... disturbing and weird. I'd try doing a fresh install, adding (and switching to, if necessary) zsh, then only visit trusted sites and see if the problem reoccurs.
[2024-01-18 04:43] <arraybolt3> There's zero good reason that I can think of for Firefox to want to access that file.
[2024-01-18 04:45] <arraybolt3> hmm, actually might not be a problem
[2024-01-18 04:45] <arraybolt3> mojtaba: over here I have AppArmor denials from FF trying to access my Bash history file.
[2024-01-18 04:46] <arraybolt3> and I'm as certain as I can be that my system isn't compromised
[2024-01-18 04:47] <arraybolt3> see also https://superuser.com/questions/1734502/why-is-firefox-accessing-my-viminfo-and-bash-history-files
[2024-01-18 04:52] <arraybolt3> maybe it's something in the Snap itself doing it, not Firefox...
[2024-01-18 05:12] <mojtaba> arraybolt3: So why it is trying to use the history?!!
[2024-01-18 05:13] <arraybolt3> Dunno. I asked some people who might know though.
[2024-01-18 05:14] <mojtaba> Wanted to escape Google :)
[2024-01-18 05:33] <thisisjaymehta> If Firfox is doing this, there is no one left to trust LOL
[2024-01-18 05:38] <mojtaba> Does anybody else see the same log for firefox?
[2024-01-18 06:05] <lunatiq> how do I mount a hdd? I've tried to do it but it says it already is but when I df -h it doesn't list
[2024-01-18 06:12] <rbox> lunatiq: what command are you typ8ng, what error do yo uget
[2024-01-18 06:15] <lunatiq> fdisk -l shows it as /dev/sda
[2024-01-18 06:15] <lunatiq> I try to mount it but it says busy or already mounted
[2024-01-18 06:15] <lunatiq> I show df -h and nothing
[2024-01-18 06:26] <Bashing-om> lunatiq: What are you working from ?
[2024-01-18 06:26] <lunatiq> cli
[2024-01-18 06:27] <Bashing-om> lunatiq: cli on the install ? where sda contains the root file system ? or what ?
[2024-01-18 06:28] <lunatiq> no it should be blank
[2024-01-18 06:28] <lunatiq> root is /
[2024-01-18 06:28] <lunatiq> sorry root are 2 nvme
[2024-01-18 06:35] <Bashing-om> lunatiq: Sorry I am not communicating very wee. We need to know where your Present Working Directory is in respect to sda.
[2024-01-18 06:35] <Bashing-om> wee/well*
[2024-01-18 06:37] <lunatiq> How do I know that Bashing-om
[2024-01-18 06:39] <Bashing-om> lunatiq: Got me - I sure can not know // what did you boot up ?
[2024-01-18 06:40] <lunatiq> I have no idea what you're asking me
[2024-01-18 06:40] <lunatiq> "what did I boot up" it's a server
[2024-01-18 06:40] <lunatiq> It's 22.04 LTS and using SSH cli
[2024-01-18 06:40] <lunatiq> it has a hdd but says it mounted when I try to mount it
[2024-01-18 06:41] <lunatiq> I check the df -h and it is not listed
[2024-01-18 06:41] <Bashing-om> lunatiq: A server that has it's boot code on the sda drive ?
[2024-01-18 06:42] <lunatiq> no
[2024-01-18 06:43] <ravage> so you have a blank HDD probably
[2024-01-18 06:43] <ravage> send the output of: fdisk -l /dev/sda | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-18 06:45] <ravage> (that assumes you are root)
[2024-01-18 07:01] <lunatiq> https://termbin.com/q9bn
[2024-01-18 07:01] <lunatiq> Sorry it took so long
[2024-01-18 07:02] <ravage> that drive is or was part of a raid
[2024-01-18 07:03] <ravage> so what do you expect to be on there?
[2024-01-18 07:03] <lunatiq> I'm installing a panel and it doesn't have this drive available
[2024-01-18 07:04] <ravage> so you do not need the existing data on that drive?
[2024-01-18 07:05] <lunatiq> No
[2024-01-18 07:06] <ravage> if you are sure that is correct you should wipe that drive first
[2024-01-18 07:07] <ravage> then. and only then you use: wipefs -a /dev/sda
[2024-01-18 07:07] <ravage> and then follow https://techguides.yt/guides/how-to-partition-format-and-auto-mount-disk-on-ubuntu-20-04/
[2024-01-18 07:08] <ravage> also if that is a server you rent and they provided you with this drive you should find a new privider
[2024-01-18 07:08] <ravage> they probably gave you a drive with existing old customer data
[2024-01-18 07:10] <ravage> really make sure that this drive is not already part of any raid that is active on your system
[2024-01-18 07:11] <lunatiq> ravage its a fresh hetzner server
[2024-01-18 07:11] <lunatiq> I'm installing a app and it doesn't list the hdd as available
[2024-01-18 07:11] <lunatiq> it only lists the nvme
[2024-01-18 07:11] <lunatiq> that's raid
[2024-01-18 07:12] <ravage> can you send the output of: fdisk -l | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-18 07:12] <ravage> and: mount | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-18 07:13] <ravage> also: cat /prod/mdstat | nc termbin.com 9999
[2024-01-18 07:19] <ravage> Sorry last one is proc
[2024-01-18 07:19] <ravage> Not prod
[2024-01-18 07:21] <lunatiq> https://termbin.com/sajj
[2024-01-18 07:22] <lunatiq> https://termbin.com/ns88
[2024-01-18 07:22] <lunatiq> https://termbin.com/gkh4
[2024-01-18 07:23] <ravage> Ok you should be safe to wipe that HDd
[2024-01-18 07:24] <ravage> Use the wipefs command and report back if it successfully removed all 3 partitionsÂ
[2024-01-18 07:24] <CosmicDJ> are you sure? sda seems to be part of the mdraid devices "md2 : active raid5 sda3[3] nvme0n1p3[1] nvme1n1p3[0]"
[2024-01-18 07:25] <ravage> Oh but that would be really bad
[2024-01-18 07:25] <ravage> Why would you mix nvme with hdd
[2024-01-18 07:26] <ravage> In that case I would recommend a reinstall and make sure that does not happen
[2024-01-18 07:26] <lunatiq> it's a fresh install
[2024-01-18 07:27] <ravage> Then their install system is messed up
[2024-01-18 07:27] <ravage> That is a combination that should not be configuredÂ
[2024-01-18 07:27] <ravage> See if you can change that on a reinstallÂ
[2024-01-18 07:28] <ravage> I don't know how their interface worke
[2024-01-18 07:28] <ravage> WorksÂ
[2024-01-18 07:28] <ravage> Make sure you only put the NVMEs in a raidÂ
[2024-01-18 07:28] <lunatiq> I don't have any control over that
[2024-01-18 07:28] <lunatiq> It just allows me to install a OS
[2024-01-18 07:29] <ravage> Then contact the supportÂ
[2024-01-18 07:29] <ravage> You really don't want to use the system like this
[2024-01-18 07:30] <lunatiq> I'm going to ask someone else thanks
[2024-01-18 07:31] <ravage> https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/operating-systems/installimage/
[2024-01-18 07:35] <lunatiq> I don't understand
[2024-01-18 07:35] <lunatiq> That's why i came here for help
[2024-01-18 07:35] <lunatiq> I tried 2 of the commands and it didn't work
[2024-01-18 07:36] <ravage> maybe it is better to find someone who knows about that stuff
[2024-01-18 07:36] <ravage> we can only help with the Ubuntu part
[2024-01-18 07:36] <ravage> you need help with the basic setup of a dedicated server
[2024-01-18 07:39] <CosmicDJ> lunatiq: you can use this setup but the sda disk will slow down both NVMe disks; since you bought a dedicated server you might want to use the full disk I/O speed?!
[2024-01-18 07:56] <Bluewolf> <lotuspsychje> Good day. So, I tried a previous kernel and it boots up without an issue. 6.3.14 is the problem one, I loaded into 6.3.39 I think. But as a side note, I've noticed my windows partition get slow when its booting. It may be a separate issue or connected?
[2024-01-18 07:58] <Bluewolf> Sorry, its: Linux version 6.5.0-14-generic which is the problematic one.
[2024-01-18 08:19] <Kartagis> I have a problem. I have installed Ubuntu desktop in UTM on Mac. However, the grub menu stayed the same. How can I at least boot to a specific option?
[2024-01-18 09:55] <OnkelTem> Hi all. Is ufw a thing? Can I use it or it's too buggy?
[2024-01-18 09:56] <OnkelTem> I don't know what's wrong with it, but right after installation, w/o any config, it fails all the time
[2024-01-18 09:56] <OnkelTem> I just needed to add a simple NAT rule, but nah... No way
[2024-01-18 09:56] <Habbie> i liked ufw until i wanted NAT; it's just not made for that
[2024-01-18 09:57] <Habbie> random search engine hit - it's not a -big- hack to add it https://gist.github.com/kimus/9315140
[2024-01-18 10:00] <OnkelTem> Habbie: w/o any rules it doesn't work on almost fresh system, that's the thing
[2024-01-18 10:00] <OnkelTem> I mean, with the default set of rules
[2024-01-18 10:00] <Habbie> "doesn't work"?
[2024-01-18 10:01] <OnkelTem> so I install it, then run `sudo ufw enable` and get this:
[2024-01-18 10:01] <OnkelTem> damn, let me restart
[2024-01-18 10:02] <OnkelTem> https://dpaste.org/G0Yrg
[2024-01-18 10:22] <rs2009> hey y'all, I've been trying to get Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10 working without any graphical issues on a 14900H with Iris Xe graphics (a7a0); there appears to be a "grid" of continuously flickering "box"es (whenever there's a new frame rendered, that is if there's any movement on the screen) on GNOME with Wayland, while on X11 there are boxes
[2024-01-18 10:22] <rs2009> exhibiting.
[2024-01-18 10:22] <rs2009> the same behavior passing through the center of the screen (not a grid per se, just a line of boxes through the center)
[2024-01-18 10:25] <rs2009> I've tried several boot parameters (i915.enable_psr=0, i915.enable_fbc=0, intel_idle.max_cstate=4), and even tried a custom-compiled kernel with the new Xe drivers (which just panics with this particular iGPU for some reason) with absolutely no luck; this doesn't happen if I disable i915 with nomodeset of course, so I was wondering if anyone's
[2024-01-18 10:25] <rs2009> faced anything similar with Iris Xe graphics and if there's any way to get it working I'm unaware of
[2024-01-18 10:30] <fweht> i seem to have conflicting node installs, i installed node 20 from snap and node 18 with apt, can i savely remove node via apt and all dependencies?  will the node from snap automatically appear in my path?
[2024-01-18 10:33] <ravage> Snap is in your path on a default installationÂ
[2024-01-18 10:33] <ravage> Usually even before your other paths
[2024-01-18 10:35] <fweht> ravage: ok cool, so ill delete the rest
[2024-01-18 10:39] <Kartagis> Firefox keeps crashing on me. Why is that?
[2024-01-18 10:39] <Kartagis> this is really annoying
[2024-01-18 10:40] <Kartagis> this gets really annoying after 4-5 times*
[2024-01-18 10:41] <Kartagis> and it keeps happening when I try syncing
[2024-01-18 10:52] <tomreyn> Kartagis: do you have some more information? whch ubuntu release are you running ( lsb_release -ds ), is your system all updated? are you using the snap or a different firefox installation?
[2024-01-18 10:52] <tomreyn> which firefox version is this?
[2024-01-18 10:54] <tomreyn> does it also happen when you run firefox in troubleshoot mode? https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/diagnose-firefox-issues-using-troubleshoot-mode
[2024-01-18 10:56] <tomreyn> when you run firefox normally, but start it from a terminal (emulator) window, does it print anything by the time it is crashing?
[2024-01-18 10:56] <Kartagis> tomreyn: 22.04.3. yes it's updated. I don't know if it's snap or something else. I can't tell you the version because it crashed as soon as I ran it.
[2024-01-18 10:57] <tomreyn> Kartagis: what does    readlink -f $(which firefox)    return?
[2024-01-18 10:58] <Kartagis> tomreyn: a question though. does it matter if I have installed ubuntu in an emulator on a Mac with Apple Silicon chip?
[2024-01-18 10:59] <tomreyn> it could matter in that you may be running the non-default (amd64) architecture, and in that the ubuntu installation might be customized
[2024-01-18 10:59] <tomreyn> how did you install ubuntu there?
[2024-01-18 11:00] <Kartagis> tomreyn: I fired up UTM and installed Ubuntu.
[2024-01-18 11:01] <tomreyn> UTM is?
[2024-01-18 11:01] <tomreyn> ah, some virtualization software for mac
[2024-01-18 11:01] <Kartagis> tomreyn: readlink says /usr/bin/firefox
[2024-01-18 11:01] <tomreyn> and you installe dubuntu by downloading it's .ISO file from ubuntu.com ?
[2024-01-18 11:02] <Kartagis> tomreyn: that's right
[2024-01-18 11:03] <tomreyn> okay, so that's a proper installation, cool.
[2024-01-18 11:03] <tomreyn> firefox -v    says what?
[2024-01-18 11:06] <Kartagis> tomreyn: firefox exited again the terminal said exiting due to a channel error
[2024-01-18 11:06] <Kartagis> firefox -v says 116.0.2
[2024-01-18 11:07] <Kartagis> is that only old or way old?
[2024-01-18 11:07] <ravage> too old for sure
[2024-01-18 11:08] <ravage> make sure firefox is closed and run: sudo snap refresh firefox
[2024-01-18 11:08] <tomreyn> maybe that's esr? but i don't think ubuntu provides that
[2024-01-18 11:09] <dawnbreaker> ubuntu server arm iso maybe does
[2024-01-18 11:09] <dawnbreaker> i was watching a utm youtube
[2024-01-18 11:10] <ravage> Kartagis: what is the output of: uname -a
[2024-01-18 11:10] <Kartagis> maybe I should install server and GUI on top of that. because I need GUI
[2024-01-18 11:11] <dawnbreaker> falkon is a good web browser too
[2024-01-18 11:11] <Kartagis> Linux tolgaozses 6.5.0-14-generic #14~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Nov 20 18:15:30 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[2024-01-18 11:12] <ravage> ok so this is a normal x64 install
[2024-01-18 11:12] <Kartagis> oh look, clipboard works
[2024-01-18 11:12] <tomreyn> 22.04 arm64 defaults to the snap as well, and it provides the same version as amd64
[2024-01-18 11:12] <ravage> snap should give you the latest stable version
[2024-01-18 11:13] <tomreyn> it would be better idea to install the ubuntu arm64 architecture build on this device, though
[2024-01-18 11:13] <ravage> that is 121 right now
[2024-01-18 11:13] <Kartagis> tomreyn: I need amd64, I have a piece of docker software which platform dependent.
[2024-01-18 11:13] <tomreyn> yes snap 121 is stable
[2024-01-18 11:13] <tomreyn> there is esr/stable (116.6esd-1), too
[2024-01-18 11:14] <tomreyn> there is esr/stable (115.6.0esr-1), too
[2024-01-18 11:14] <tomreyn> sorry, i'm fat fingered
[2024-01-18 11:14] <ravage> but then he installed that version manually at some point
[2024-01-18 11:14] <ravage> and yes that would be 115 not 116
[2024-01-18 11:14] <tomreyn> i think the esr snap would report that it is "esr" on -v
[2024-01-18 11:15] <tomreyn> so, ye,s looks like a mnual, outdated, firefox installation
[2024-01-18 11:15] <Kartagis> ...and firefox crashed again
[2024-01-18 11:16] <tomreyn> Kartagis: so what does   snap list firefox    and    apt list --installed firefox   say?
[2024-01-18 11:17] <Kartagis> tomreyn: if you're asking if it's a snap, yes snap list listed firefox
[2024-01-18 11:17] <tomreyn> and what happens when you   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -V    ? pleasde show the full output on a pastebin, we suggest https://dpaste.com
[2024-01-18 11:20] <Kartagis> upgrading now
[2024-01-18 11:21] <tomreyn> hope this fixes it - i got to leave for now. good luck!
[2024-01-18 11:22] <Kartagis> thanks a lot
[2024-01-18 11:27] <tomreyn> you're welcome - if you run into more / related issues, just ask again
[2024-01-18 11:27] <Kartagis> wee, it didn't crash now.
[2024-01-18 11:27] <Kartagis> it is syncing
[2024-01-18 11:29] <tomreyn> running outdated software is dangerous, try to make sure that updates will happen automatically or you have a weekly schedule + reminder to install updates manually
[2024-01-18 11:30] <Kartagis> will do that
[2024-01-18 11:34] <dawnbreaker> tell us if it works
[2024-01-18 11:44] <Kartagis> for some fricking reason, it just started crashing again. I have no other way but to install chrome and import my bookmarks
[2024-01-18 11:45] <Kartagis> it being firefox
[2024-01-18 11:45] <Kartagis> if not ff itself, the tab crashes
[2024-01-18 11:49] <dawnbreaker> how much ram do you have..maybe idk
[2024-01-18 11:51] <Kartagis> dawnbreaker: I allocated 4gb
[2024-01-18 11:55] <dawnbreaker> kinda small amount but idk how much you need
[2024-01-18 11:56] <dawnbreaker> you can run firefox from a terminal and see if theres errors when it crashes
[2024-01-18 11:58] <dawnbreaker> oh wait that doesnt work
[2024-01-18 11:58] <dawnbreaker> it escapes
[2024-01-18 12:00] <Kartagis> dabbill: the terminal says "exiting due to a channel error"
[2024-01-18 12:01] <Kartagis> dawnbreaker: the terminal says "exiting due to a channel error"
[2024-01-18 12:02] <Kartagis> dawnbreaker: I probably need more than 4gb because GUI
[2024-01-18 12:02] <dawnbreaker> maybe snap refresh
[2024-01-18 12:03] <dawnbreaker> google channels for snap
[2024-01-18 12:14] <dawnbreaker> Kartagis: do snap refresh then snap install firefox

[2024-01-18 12:16] <tito> hello every body
[2024-01-18 13:38] <de-facto> what is this now? updates of my 22.04 popped up offering updates and now it REQUIRES UBUNTU PRO?
[2024-01-18 13:39] <de-facto> did ubuntu just became non-free as of providing updates to users?
[2024-01-18 13:40] <ravage> !pro | de-facro
[2024-01-18 13:40] <ubottu> de-facro: Ubuntu Pro is a service offered by Canonical for expanded CVE patching, ten-years security maintenance and optional support. Anyone can use Ubuntu Pro for free for personal use on up to 5 machines. For details please see https://ubuntu.com/pro and https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-pro-faq
[2024-01-18 13:40] <de-facto> i cant update without it anymore: https://i.imgur.com/7d6qMIK.png
[2024-01-18 13:41] <de-facto> i never activated any ubuntu pro, it enforces membership now for providing updates?
[2024-01-18 13:41] <ravage> Please read the FAQÂ
[2024-01-18 13:43] <de-facto> this really is offputting, i DONT want this ubuntu pro crap
[2024-01-18 13:43] <de-facto> so how do i get updates without ubuntu pro now?
[2024-01-18 13:44] <younder> I have use ubuntu for  18 years and have never used ubuntu pro
[2024-01-18 13:44] <de-facto> and now they enforce it on users apparently
[2024-01-18 13:44] <younder> Every 2 years erase you disk and  a new LTS version (or 4)
[2024-01-18 13:45] <younder> Upgrades never turn out well anyhow. For me anyhow.
[2024-01-18 13:45] <de-facto> if i cant get updates anymore its the end for ubuntu and me
[2024-01-18 13:45] <ravage> Good luck on your future endeavors then
[2024-01-18 13:46] <younder> If you have something you can't afford to loose back it up (and make sure it restores)
[2024-01-18 13:47] <ravage> younder: sorry who are you talking to? Can we help your with something?
[2024-01-18 13:51] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-18 13:53] <lunatiq> I don't understand how I can remove this raid. I've tried everything.
[2024-01-18 13:53] <lunatiq> I've used installimage and removed the swraid 0
[2024-01-18 13:53] <lunatiq> I have commented it
[2024-01-18 13:53] <lunatiq> I have set raid 0
[2024-01-18 13:54] <lunatiq> the hdd still doesn't show in fstab
[2024-01-18 13:55] <CosmicDJ> lunatiq: raid0?! are you sure you want that? 1 failed disk and the whole raid is gone...
[2024-01-18 13:56] <lunatiq> CosmicDJ I really dont want any raid at all
[2024-01-18 13:57] <lunatiq> I've tried to remove it entirely but it won't
[2024-01-18 13:58] <CosmicDJ> running wipefs from a rescue boot should clean your disks of any raid/lvm/fs traces... though you'll have to reinstall your OS then
[2024-01-18 13:59] <leftyfb> lunatiq: I hope you're not expecting to "remove the swraid 0" and retain anything
[2024-01-18 14:00] <lunatiq> https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/b161beda7c96440e884ba148ca2c87a8
[2024-01-18 14:00] <lunatiq> This is what is available
[2024-01-18 14:00] <leftyfb> lunatiq: just repartition and reformat the drive
[2024-01-18 14:00] <lunatiq> how
[2024-01-18 14:01] <leftyfb> fdisk, sgdisk, parted, gparted, mkfs, etc
[2024-01-18 14:01] <lunatiq> You know what that means
[2024-01-18 14:01] <lunatiq> I don't
[2024-01-18 14:01] <leftyfb> lunatiq: open gparted
[2024-01-18 14:02] <leftyfb> lunatiq: again, be less concerned about "removing raid" and just start the process of using the drive as you prefer. You will not be retaining any data off it
[2024-01-18 14:05] <dnadev2_> hello. i want to install the xscreensaver package on 22.04 and noticed the installed version is very old (5.45), and the author recommends the newest version (6.08). so i have two questions: 1. is this package "safe" to use in general, i imagine theres a reason ubuntu doesnt ship with it/update the version. 2. if safe, how to install the latest version (hopefully using apt). thanks!
[2024-01-18 14:06] <leftyfb> !latest | dnadev2_
[2024-01-18 14:06] <ubottu> dnadev2_: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[2024-01-18 14:09] <dnadev2_> leftyfb: awesome thanks. so safest bet is to use whatever is ubuntu maintains as the "latest stable" in their eyes (generally speaking)
[2024-01-18 14:10] <lunatiq> https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/dedicated-server/raid/software-raid/
[2024-01-18 14:10] <lunatiq> found this!!!
[2024-01-18 14:10] <lunatiq> OMG
[2024-01-18 14:10] <lunatiq> I hope it works!
[2024-01-18 14:13] <ll8> good lo/
[2024-01-18 14:23] <dawnbreaker> why cant snaps write to another disk than my os disk?
[2024-01-18 14:24] <dawnbreaker> how do i do it. i want to open the second disk in terminal then yt-dlp but says permission denied
[2024-01-18 14:24] <dawnbreaker> i did chown myname disk
[2024-01-18 14:25] <leftyfb> permission denied doesn't sound like a snap issue, it sounds like a permission issue
[2024-01-18 14:25] <dawnbreaker> oh
[2024-01-18 14:25] <leftyfb> dawnbreaker: can you "touch /path/to/disk/somefilename" ?
[2024-01-18 14:26] <dawnbreaker> alls i did was format the new disk then go into media then chown myname disk
[2024-01-18 14:26] <leftyfb> dawnbreaker: can you "touch /path/to/disk/somefilename" ?
[2024-01-18 14:26] <dawnbreaker> hold on ill try
[2024-01-18 14:27] <dawnbreaker> it did it but didnt return nothing in text in terminal
[2024-01-18 14:28] <dawnbreaker> oh wait sorry
[2024-01-18 14:28] <dawnbreaker> let me make file
[2024-01-18 14:29] <dawnbreaker> yeah same thing. command goes through without any text output
[2024-01-18 14:30] <ravage> If you write to a removable media there is a permission to allow that
[2024-01-18 14:30] <lunatiq> why does mkfs take so long
[2024-01-18 14:30] <lunatiq> for ext3
[2024-01-18 14:31] <leftyfb> lunatiq: use ext4
[2024-01-18 14:31] <ravage> If you want to write to another disk outside your home you have to use a bind mountÂ
[2024-01-18 14:31] <dawnbreaker> i can make folders on it and files with my user
[2024-01-18 14:31] <dawnbreaker> but the yt-dlp snap says permission denied
[2024-01-18 14:32] <dawnbreaker> geany ide allows me
[2024-01-18 14:32] <dawnbreaker> geany is a deb
[2024-01-18 14:34] <leftyfb> dawnbreaker: sudo snap connect yt-dlp:removable-media
[2024-01-18 14:34] <dawnbreaker> ah cool thanks leftyfb
[2024-01-18 14:41] <dawnbreaker> ok yeah works
[2024-01-18 15:24] <tomreyn> Kartagis: "Exiting due to channel error" is a follow-up error message, where a child process chooses to exit because it's main process has 'vanished'. there should be more error messages before this one, indicating why the main prcess exited / failed.
[2024-01-18 15:26] <tomreyn> Kartagis: see this for steps you can take to analyze this better, possibly solve it, or provide qualified feedback to Mozilla (who maintain the snap). https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-firefox-crashes-closing-or-quitting
[2024-01-18 15:27] <tomreyn> also make sure your snap is now the latest version, 121.0.1-1
[2024-01-18 15:27] <tomreyn> firefox -v    should tell
[2024-01-18 15:29] <tomreyn> you can also try starting firefox with --safe-mode or -P and create a new profile
[2024-01-18 15:36] <SnoopJ> How do I query the installed version of a package in a locale-agnostic way? I am currently doing `apt-cache policy <pkg> | grep "Version:"` but this is not appropriate for a non-English locale, and I don't want to fix this multiple times for each language
[2024-01-18 15:37] <SnoopJ> Sorry, that's `â¦ | grep "Installed:"`
[2024-01-18 15:43] <johnfg> hi folks
[2024-01-18 15:44] <johnfg> This laptop I'm on finds my wifi fine.  Running 22.04.
[2024-01-18 15:44] <johnfg> My other laptop is not finding it.  I've looked at settings, but don't see what's wrong.
[2024-01-18 15:45] <johnfg> If I boot up windows, win 10 finds and connects to the wifi, then rebooting to ubuntu, it finds it.  What's up?
[2024-01-18 15:46] <tomreyn> disable fast startup in windows
[2024-01-18 15:48] <tomreyn> https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-disable-or-enable-fast-startup-in-windows-8-1/
[2024-01-18 15:48] <tomreyn> SnoopJ: LANG=C
[2024-01-18 15:48] <johnfg> So you're thinking one laptop has that disabled and not the other?  They are almost clones.
[2024-01-18 15:49] <SnoopJ> tomreyn, I need this to work without modifying the locale.
[2024-01-18 15:51] <tomreyn> johnfg: i'm thinking that the laptop where linux is sometimes unable to initialize the wireless, experiences this when windows does not shut down cleanly, i.e. "fast startup", and the firmware is left in a bad state and not fully reinitialized on boot (to linux).
[2024-01-18 15:51] <SnoopJ> or hm, maybe I can get away with it. But I'd much prefer to have a way to "just" ask the package system to tell me the version without doing that, it feels more brittle.
[2024-01-18 15:52] <tomreyn> SnoopJ: dpkg-query has a --format option which lets you configure the output format as you wish.
[2024-01-18 15:53] <SnoopJ> I was just looking at that. I think `dpkg-query --showformat="\${Version}" -W <pkg>` does what I wanted. Thanks.
[2024-01-18 15:54] <tomreyn> ah so it's --showformat, not --format, sorry
[2024-01-18 15:55] <tomreyn> i think --showformat and -W do the same, though
[2024-01-18 15:58] <ioria> and still uses 'Version'
[2024-01-18 15:59] <SnoopJ> it does but the format field names don't vary by locale
[2024-01-18 15:59] <ioria> maybe : dpkg -l|grep -E '(^|\s)firefox($|\s)'| awk '{print $3}'
[2024-01-18 16:00] <SnoopJ> (I replaced -W with --show in my real usage just to be consistent, as well)
[2024-01-18 16:01] <SnoopJ> e.g. `LANGUAGE=ja dpkg-query --showformat="\${Version}" --show apt` works fine (a `ja` locale is where the originating issue came from, but a single success here gives me confidence enough)
[2024-01-18 16:31] <IAmVeryLost>  i am currently running Ubuntu on my laptop with no other OS installed, i was wondering how can i dual boot Kali Linux.

[2024-01-18 16:32] <leftyfb> IAmVeryLost: can I ask why you think you need Kali Linux? You know a lot of the packages included are available to install in ubuntu right?
[2024-01-18 16:34] <IAmVeryLost> Yea, i heard that kali has a lot of security programs so i wanted to try it. A couple of years ago i tried to install it on my raspberry pi with no luck. So i want to try it again
[2024-01-18 17:38] <derek-shnosh> Ubuntu 23.10; A few times now, a dialogue box has popped up while I'm typing something and my key entries (space?) close it before I can read it. Is there a way to see recent prompts/dialogues in logs? Or elsewhere?
[2024-01-18 17:53] <puff> Good afternoon.  I make extensive use of virtual desktops, but I also use an external monitor with my laptop.  Most of the time I have the laptop lid closed, but smetimes I need to use the web cam built into my laptop.  When I open the laptop, then all the windows I have open get moved to a single virtual desktop, and then I have to rearrange things.
[2024-01-18 17:53] <puff> Is there any way to avoid this?
[2024-01-18 18:44] <mojtaba> Hello, I am using Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS and I using Firefox 120.0.1 (64-bit).

Does anybody know why it needs to access that file and if it is legit?

[2024-01-18 20:37] <bmbbsr52> the update must have killed some libs

[2024-01-18 22:42] <stan101> I just want to know what the skinny is so as i can make things right.
[2024-01-18 22:43] <stan101> you know - back 6 months ago - i was talking ham radio - during that time - a silent partner spoke up confident in my abiities- and had zero internet presents.
[2024-01-18 22:44] <stan101> ubuntu is slick - I appreciate that - but- my gut says different.
[2024-01-18 22:45] <ham> well, then follow your gut and don't use it ?
[2024-01-18 22:46] <stan101> haha they love ruining your resolution
[2024-01-18 22:47] <stan101> looks like im right

[2024-01-19 00:59] <BoxBunny> do y have any idea to use vpn on usb-tethering
[2024-01-19 04:40] <kotgc> Hello, someone gave me this code but it fails https://dpaste.com/C2H4L6VZW
[2024-01-19 04:40] <kotgc> My research shows a different way to tar something https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tar-command-linux-examples/
[2024-01-19 04:40] <kotgc> What do I need to do?
[2024-01-19 04:43] <rbox> the name of the file needs to be next to the f, but also, you're not telling it what to add to the tar
[2024-01-19 04:45] <kotgc> rbox thx, I'm trying to backup a failed OS from this LiveUSB

[2024-01-19 09:25] <Kartagis> I have a problem. I have installed Ubuntu desktop in UTM on Mac. However, the grub menu stayed the same. How can I at least boot to a specific option?
[2024-01-19 09:29] <CosmicDJ> Kartagis: maybe UTM is still booting from the ubuntu install iso? did you try "ejecting" the iso/cdrom?
[2024-01-19 09:30] <Kartagis> CosmicDJ: yes I did, it then says "Not found" or something like that.
[2024-01-19 09:30] <CosmicDJ> Kartagis: maybe follow the guide closely? https://docs.getutm.app/guides/ubuntu/
[2024-01-19 09:34] <Kartagis> oh, I probably need to stop the VM to umount the ISO
[2024-01-19 09:36] <rainfly> \
[2024-01-19 09:39] <Kartagis> CosmicDJ: yes, I did need to do that. I stopped the VM and ejected the ISO.
[2024-01-19 09:40] <ravage> Kartagis: you are on Apple Silicon? it is not officially supported here but maybe you want to check out https://asahilinux.org/
[2024-01-19 09:42] <ravage> or to be more precise https://github.com/UbuntuAsahi/ubuntu-asahi
[2024-01-19 09:44] <Kartagis> ravage: yeah, I was told about that too. this looks like a dual-boot at first glance.
[2024-01-19 09:51] <rainfly> Why the hell would you install other software on MacBooks?
[2024-01-19 09:51] <rainfly> I mean other OS
[2024-01-19 09:53] <wyre> hi guys, I've installed memtest86+ and updated grub ... but update-grub doesn't add the entry to grub.cfg
[2024-01-19 09:53] <wyre> why is this?
[2024-01-19 09:55] <Kartagis> rainfly: I have a piece of software dependent on x86
[2024-01-19 10:02] <rainfly> Can't you just test it on other PC? Is installing linux on mac reversable?
[2024-01-19 10:05] <Kartagis> rainfly: I'm not ditching macOS, I'd never do that.
[2024-01-19 10:06] <CosmicDJ> rainfly: UTM is a VM software like VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation
[2024-01-19 10:09] <wyre> it's a fresh install so ... not sure why memtest86+ doesn't come by default
[2024-01-19 10:39] <simonov123> hi
[2024-01-19 10:39] <simonov123> nice to meet you,my pleasure Lucio
[2024-01-19 10:40] <simonov123> i developed an application for ubuntu
[2024-01-19 10:40] <simonov123> and i want to pubblish on your repositories
[2024-01-19 10:41] <simonov123> how to do it?
[2024-01-19 10:41] <ravage> simonov123: the fastest way is to look at https://snapcraft.io
[2024-01-19 10:42] <simonov123> so i need toÂ  turn my deb in a snap
[2024-01-19 10:43] <ravage> deb is a supported plugin
[2024-01-19 10:44] <rainfly> Is there a safe tool like BitLocker for Ubuntu?
[2024-01-19 10:44] <Paris> there is a tool to build a deb package from your app, that can be install like the other one, then it needs to be accepted in the official repository, you gotta submit itto the official packagers or something.
[2024-01-19 10:45] <ravage> rainfly: the installer supports full disk encryption. if you want to encrypt an external drive open "Disks"
[2024-01-19 10:45] <ravage> you can create luks encrypted partitions there
[2024-01-19 10:46] <simonov123> my deb package has already been built and working,i have just to put it on repository,i'm looking for the channel for communicate with official repository
[2024-01-19 10:46] <Haris_> hello all
[2024-01-19 10:48] <Haris_> I'm on 20.x LTS. I'm trying to customize path for mysql server. on configuration, and subsequent mysqld start, it fails. then when I run mysqld --initialize it gives me a stupid error ===> mysqld: Can't create directory '/mnt/custom/path/' (OS errno 13 - Permission denied) <=== I'm running all of this as root on this instance
[2024-01-19 10:48] <Haris_> instance = VM
[2024-01-19 10:49] <Haris_> Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. codename: focal
[2024-01-19 10:49] <ravage> The MySQLd process will still use the user defined in the configurationÂ
[2024-01-19 10:50] <ravage> The default user is mysql
[2024-01-19 10:50] <ravage> So make sure that user can write there
[2024-01-19 10:51] <Haris_> I had to delete that folder b/c mysqld --initialize gives me the error that folder already exists
[2024-01-19 10:51] <Haris_> mysqld: Can't create directory '/mnt/custom/path/' (OS errno 17 - File exists)
[2024-01-19 10:52] <Haris_> (2) I'v had to put my custom config in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.conf. Is this where I customize my.cnf role config file for it?
[2024-01-19 10:58] <Haris_> Is there a way to initialize mysql w/ a custom path on focal?
[2024-01-19 10:59] <Haris_> user mysql exists. I already created the folder and applied the ownership/permissions. then I had to delete it when I got this error
[2024-01-19 11:00] <Haris_> Is mysql config hard-coded somewhere, where I have to adapt to make it work with custom path on focal?
[2024-01-19 11:01] <Haris_> I can see it in audit log apparmor is denying mysql for this
[2024-01-19 11:08] <Haris_> how to adapt apparmor to make mysqld work with custom datadir path? I added custom paths in apprmor. reloaded two times. restarted apparmor once. still I get permission denied on mysqld --initialize
[2024-01-19 11:21] <Haris_> guys .. anyone around? I can't proceed with my work b/c of this
[2024-01-19 11:21] <wyre> there is no linux-image pacakges in focal-backports? https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=focal-backports&searchon=names&keywords=linux-image
[2024-01-19 11:26] <CosmicDJ> wyre: why should there be one?
[2024-01-19 11:36] <Haris_> what config file does mysql client use on focal?
[2024-01-19 11:36] <Haris_> got mysqld working with custom datadir
[2024-01-19 11:41] <tomreyn> Haris_: man mysql   should tell
[2024-01-19 11:42] <Haris_> It may. reading it. What's the default for ubuntu/focal as an OS/platform?
[2024-01-19 11:43] <tomreyn> in the past, the default per user mysql client configuration location was ~/.my.cnf (if I remember correctly).
[2024-01-19 11:44] <tomreyn> defaults can change, but i assume this one has not
[2024-01-19 11:45] <Haris_> nothing in /etc/default for mysql server
[2024-01-19 11:45] <Haris_> or client
[2024-01-19 11:45] <tomreyn> i wouldn't expect anything there
[2024-01-19 11:47] <Haris_> when I run ===> mysql -u root -p <=== I get the error ===> mysql: [ERROR] unknown variable 'datadir=/mnt/custom/mysql/path'.
[2024-01-19 11:47] <Haris_> where is it getting this from
[2024-01-19 11:47] <tomreyn> there should just be /etc/mysql and the per user location. potentially, if you modified things a lot, mysqld might also be looking in the database storage directory (/var/lib/mysql by default)
[2024-01-19 11:48] <Haris_> its giving me my custom configured path
[2024-01-19 11:48] <tomreyn> so you configured it, so you'll know where it gets it from?
[2024-01-19 11:50] <tomreyn> you can always use strace to see which file system paths a given software accesses (or tries to access).
[2024-01-19 11:51] <tomreyn> changing the default mysql data directory is probably somewhat involved due to apparmor and possibly other reasons. so if you don't strictly have to, don't. certainly someone will already have done so, and listed the needed steps, though.
[2024-01-19 11:52] <Haris_> ok. I commented my config in /etc/mysql/conf.d/mysql.conf
[2024-01-19 11:52] <Haris_> now it gives me the password prompt. but gives me the error that it can't connect to mysql using the socket file on the custom datadir path
[2024-01-19 11:55] <Haris_> we almost never use the default datadir path. untill its an inconsequential implementation. I'm used CentOS. I don't have to worry about these basic things there. it initilizes mysqld with custom datadir path with no further kinks required
[2024-01-19 11:56] <rainfly> What's the biggest offense for Ubuntu users?
[2024-01-19 11:58] <Haris_> mentioning CentOS?
[2024-01-19 11:59] <Haris_> or something that works on another platform w/ not much changing around?
[2024-01-19 12:02] <Haris_> got it working
[2024-01-19 12:02] <Haris_> put bad path in ~/.my.cnf for cliient socket
[2024-01-19 12:02] <Haris_> $s/cliient/client/
[2024-01-19 12:03] <Haris_> $ = %
[2024-01-19 12:05] <iomari891> Greetings, I just noticed that pip3 is working again. I no longer have t use pipx. What happened?
[2024-01-19 12:50] <rainfly> If my hard-drive is encrypted with some built-in tool, is it possible to create .iso copy of my entire system with disks via clonezilla?
[2024-01-19 13:12] <Paris> you can make a 1:1 copy, and it will be crypted the same.
[2024-01-19 13:15] <CosmicDJ> what's the goal of making a clonezilla copy? if you're using TPM-backed FD encryption you can't just "unclone" the iso on a new computer and get access to your data AFAIK https://ubuntu.com/blog/tpm-backed-full-disk-encryption-is-coming-to-ubuntu
[2024-01-19 13:16] <tmm88> heyho everyone
[2024-01-19 13:16] <tmm88> what's wrong with wsl2 ubuntu mirrors?
[2024-01-19 13:16] <tmm88> can't find weechat and irssi
[2024-01-19 13:17] <ravage> there are no wsl2 mirrors
[2024-01-19 13:17] <tmm88> nodejs has user privilge restrictoions
[2024-01-19 13:17] <tmm88> ubuntu
[2024-01-19 13:17] <ravage> wsl uses the standard ubuntu archive mirrors
[2024-01-19 13:17] <tmm88> *ubuntu mirrors
[2024-01-19 13:17] <tmm88> that's what i mean
[2024-01-19 13:17] <tmm88> my apologies
[2024-01-19 13:17] <tmm88> can't find weechat and irssi
[2024-01-19 13:18] <tmm88> and i see a lot of restrictions with nodejs and python
[2024-01-19 13:18] <tmm88> has weechat and irssi been removed
[2024-01-19 13:19] <tmm88> or has some kind of idiot claimed in front of canonical that specfiic users shall not access internet relay chat via the proper clients, because that may pose as an international security threat? i mean, is learning computer science a threat or a protecting veil for sanitizing the web?
[2024-01-19 13:23] <CosmicDJ> tmm88: you really expect some help with that attitude?
[2024-01-19 13:30] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-19 13:37] <tomreyn> tmm88: if you can share some terminal output or logs of your attempts to install the software (after updating apt's cache) on a pastebin, i bet someone over here could help.
[2024-01-19 13:37] <tomreyn> if you need help with doing this, please just ask, too.
[2024-01-19 13:39] <tomreyn> rainfly: by ".iso copy", do you mean a bootable iso? and what's your goal there?
[2024-01-19 13:40] <tomreyn> (i mean; why do you need this?)
[2024-01-19 13:45] <rainfly> I have SD card with entrire system on it. I want to create .iso backup but im not sure if it's gonna work if its encrypted.
[2024-01-19 13:45] <rainfly> The main purpose of the backup is to get the previous state of the machine
[2024-01-19 13:46] <rainfly> My apologies if my question was not so precise
[2024-01-19 13:47] <tomreyn> having the entire system on an sd card isn't a great setup, because this is rather short-lived / unreliable storage. are you using hardware which can only use an sdcard for storage?
[2024-01-19 13:48] <tomreyn> full disk encryption with many writes to the crypto container on an sdcard would be an especially bad idea, i'm afraid, because the crypto container will increase the amount of writes (if not *that* much)
[2024-01-19 13:50] <koom> what kind of crypto container?
[2024-01-19 13:50] <Psil0> rainfly, i am guessing its for raspberry pi?
[2024-01-19 13:50] <Psil0> sd card?
[2024-01-19 13:50] <rainfly> I mean, it's a small computer (like raspberryPI, but not exactly)
[2024-01-19 13:50] <tomreyn> rainfly: you can create an image of the sdcard and store that on different storage media. it will be larger than a file-system backup, that, too, can be encrypted.
[2024-01-19 13:51] <rainfly> TBH it doesn't have to be encrypted, but my system currently is.
[2024-01-19 13:51] <rainfly> I can operate it easily but what's gonna happen if i just use some tool to backup it
[2024-01-19 13:51] <Psil0> i am just interested why its encrypted usually those systems cannot handle encryption maybe i am wrong
[2024-01-19 13:51] <Psil0> you can encrpyt raspbian?
[2024-01-19 13:52] <rainfly> Idk, my friend told me that he needs some kind of point to go back. Its Ubuntu with ROS.
[2024-01-19 13:57] <tomreyn> rainfly: i just through about this more. it may indeed be the most simple solution to just create a 1-to-1 image of the sd card if it's small enough. as long as you just read but not restore it, casing little stress to the sd card, that should be fine. it should also be reasonably fast if the sd card isn't that large. it will still be slower than a proper backup, plus you can't create it while the system is running.
[2024-01-19 13:57] <tomreyn> casing -> causing (just)
[2024-01-19 13:58] <rainfly> Thanks, I will try to work on it
[2024-01-19 13:58] <tomreyn> so, for example, if you want to do nightly image dumps of the sd card in a different computer, this could be an option.
[2024-01-19 13:58] <tomreyn> personally, i'd prefer the online backup approach.
[2024-01-19 13:58] <tomreyn> !backup
[2024-01-19 13:58] <ubottu> There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !sbackup, !borg, and !cloning
[2024-01-19 13:59] <tomreyn> i'd recommend borg or restic
[2024-01-19 14:02] <tomreyn> rainfly: if your SoC provides an USB or a SATA bus, you should prefer those and use a better storage media (such as a modern SSD) on it.
[2024-01-19 14:05] <rainfly> The SD card was a prototype. I know that this is not the best way to keep your system running.
[2024-01-19 14:07] <plundra> Where is the repo for the cloud-image build process? The jammy images >= 20240117 has added a sshd_config.d/10-cloudimg-settings.conf disabling PasswordAuthentication, so doing ssh_pwauth: true in cloud-init, that creates 50-cloud-init.conf with PasswordAuthentication=yes no longer works.
[2024-01-19 14:07] <tomreyn> #ubuntu-cloud might have more info on this
[2024-01-19 14:08] <plundra> Gotcha! Thanks.
[2024-01-19 14:09] <amcsi__> hey, is it typical for a new Ubuntu server to disallow external SSH connection using ipv6?
[2024-01-19 14:10] <tomreyn> amcsi__: depends on whether you installed openssh or not. ipv4 and ipv6 should be treated the same, if it's a standard installation.
[2024-01-19 14:10] <amcsi__> I'm created an Ubuntu server in Azure that has a public ipv4 and ipv6, and I'm able to connect with ipv4, but not ipv6. I just want to rule out the firewall on the machine before looking into fixing the issue in the Azure security layer
[2024-01-19 14:11] <tomreyn> i'm not familiar with azures' images.
[2024-01-19 14:13] <amcsi__> oh wait, the problem may be a lot closer than I thought
[2024-01-19 14:13] <tomreyn> try    lsof -i :22    and use netcat or similar to connect to port 22 both from inside and outside the system
[2024-01-19 14:13] <amcsi__> I don't have IPv6 enabled on my own machine :D
[2024-01-19 14:13] <amcsi__> turns out
[2024-01-19 14:13] <tomreyn> :)
[2024-01-19 15:31] <szstr> i got scared i installed tntnet un' i thought it did bad
[2024-01-19 15:32] <szstr> i'll stick to just php with awachee next time hehehe
[2024-01-19 15:36] <szstr> the most robustwares ayn the akt rekoz are usually the most sussy
[2024-01-19 15:37] <szstr> the name tntnet sounds like: "eliminar mein system" though lol
[2024-01-19 15:39] <szstr> linux always has sussy names
[2024-01-19 15:40] <aiena> While testing and developing apparmor profiles. Iis it ok to chown a profile in etc/apparmor.d/ to the regular owner, edit and reload it and then finally switch to root or will it not work if the profile is not owned by the root user?
[2024-01-19 15:41] <aiena> regular user/profile developer
[2024-01-19 15:41] <leftyfb> aiena: I'm pretty sure there's no reason anything in /etc/ needs to be owned by anyone else other than root. Especially apparmor profiles
[2024-01-19 15:41] <aiena> hmm I guess the alternative is running my text editor as root but I don't like that
[2024-01-19 15:42] <aiena> user created profiles not default ones
[2024-01-19 15:42] <aiena> vim is ok but i dont know if its a good idea for featherpad etc.
[2024-01-19 15:43] <szstr> aiena: ayt u must set the chgrp to something ur user is ayn then chmod -R 0770 /etc/apparmor.d/ with a limited time Grrr name. use nano text editor ayn terminal as root
[2024-01-19 15:43] <szstr> or whategher, my adshice aysz limited
[2024-01-19 15:44] <aiena> the group idea is interesting its a vm so I could ignore all the rules too but I want to do something in the middle
[2024-01-19 15:44] <aiena> like I am actually sysadminin'g for a group of ....
[2024-01-19 15:45] <leftyfb> aiena: apparmor profiles are more of an administration thing. Not really something end users tend to mess with
[2024-01-19 15:45] <aiena> yes
[2024-01-19 15:45] <szstr> then grrrrr ayzs ayn/in the middle ground solution but when u install new things -- the grrr settings will be '''ayntage
[2024-01-19 15:45] <leftyfb> it's similar to selinux or grsec
[2024-01-19 15:46] <leftyfb> szstr: can we please speak clear English?
[2024-01-19 15:46] <szstr> yes?
[2024-01-19 15:46] <aiena> yes I said I am practicing linux security to sysadmin a small group of people.
[2024-01-19 15:46] <aiena> I was learning selinux but then realisied ubuntu uses apparmor
[2024-01-19 15:46] <aiena> had setup selinux in a kubuntu vm but realised that might not be a good idea
[2024-01-19 15:47] <aiena> its beeter to use it on fedora/rocky etc
[2024-01-19 15:47] <leftyfb> aiena: right, so the proper way to do this is managing the configs as root/sudo. Not as an end user
[2024-01-19 15:47] <aiena> thank you
[2024-01-19 15:47] <szstr> nothing is a good ideeea when you can't use root like a light switch un---orjunately
[2024-01-19 15:48] <aiena> I guess using vim /terminal editor then is a better idea
[2024-01-19 15:48] <leftyfb> szstr: can we help you with something?
[2024-01-19 15:48] <szstr> are u asking nicely?
[2024-01-19 15:48] <aiena> leftyfb, I think he's using English in a funny way but the message is there.
[2024-01-19 15:49] <aiena> szstr, yes please use normal ENglish if possible I can understand you but it doesn't mean all can.
[2024-01-19 15:49] <aiena> also he/she/it
[2024-01-19 15:51] <szstr> good luck with teaching sound unix krincibles aiena it's not easy as there is always better solutions elsewhere, like snackd
[2024-01-19 15:51] <aiena> I am not teaching anyone anything
[2024-01-19 15:52] <aiena> Though I beleive all students can teacha dnall teacher can learn as students
[2024-01-19 15:52] <leftyfb> feel free to discuss further in #ubuntu-offtopic
[2024-01-19 15:52] <aiena> *teach and all
[2024-01-19 15:52] <aiena> yes fair point I think I'll move over to ubuntu security since I want to learn apparmor
[2024-01-19 15:52] <leftyfb> good luk
[2024-01-19 15:52] <leftyfb> luck*
[2024-01-19 16:49] <radix0> This is a half-help, half-rant question - when did the PDF for Ubuntu server become so terrible? I open it, all the bookmarks are broken, and topics I expect to be documented are not there (SNMPv3). I don't remember it being this awful.
[2024-01-19 16:51] <ogra_> radix0, this is probably better adressed to #ubuntu-server
[2024-01-19 16:59] <alcosta> Hi everybody! I found a bug when trying to newly install ubuntu 20.04 on one of my disks with an usb pen from the original iso image.
[2024-01-19 17:00] <alcosta> I solved the problem but, somebody other can find the same issue!
[2024-01-19 17:01] <alcosta> My solution is a bit weird as weird was the problem!
[2024-01-19 17:02] <alcosta> Can somebody read what i'm saying?
[2024-01-19 17:03] <EriC^^> yes alcosta
[2024-01-19 17:03] <alcosta> Hi Eric^^
[2024-01-19 17:03] <alcosta> Is the question interesting for somebody?
[2024-01-19 17:04] <EriC^^> if you wanna share go ahead, also if you want to file a bug report you can use
[2024-01-19 17:04] <EriC^^> !bugs
[2024-01-19 17:04] <ubottu> If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please report it using the command Â« ubuntu-bug <package> Â» - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[2024-01-19 17:04] <alcosta> I would like to explain better my problem!
[2024-01-19 17:06] <EriC^^> ok, go for it
[2024-01-19 17:07] <alcosta> I have a display ASUS 28" with resolution of 3'840x2'160 pixels and a graphic card Nvidia GEforce GT710.
[2024-01-19 17:08] <EriC^^> aha
[2024-01-19 17:09] <alcosta> AT the first boot from the usb pen, after some indication that ubuntu is starting, the screen went black and the monitor hibernates!
[2024-01-19 17:10] <alcosta> I had the intuition that, maybe, the operating system was not able to manage the high resolution display.
[2024-01-19 17:11] <alcosta> I connected to the same graphic card, another display, philips, 22", with low (!) resolution of 1920x1080 and... the system started!
[2024-01-19 17:12] <EriC^^> nice
[2024-01-19 17:13] <alcosta> The i saw able to download the proper dirves for the graphic card (nvidia-driver-470) and subsequently all was right! The system was newly capable to start with the high resolution display! :)
[2024-01-19 17:14] <alcosta> Sorry! The i saw = Then i was...
[2024-01-19 17:14] <peter_shoes_> Hey, does anyone have a link to information on IRC etiquette? I'm joining some channels for gcc development and I'd like to not look too stupid ...
[2024-01-19 17:14] <tomreyn> the /topic has one which applies to this channel
[2024-01-19 17:15] <EriC^^> sounds good alcosta
[2024-01-19 17:15] <tomreyn> peter_shoes_: for generic irc questions which relate to this irc network (libera), you could try asking in #libera
[2024-01-19 17:16] <alcosta> I solved the problem but... after some days of troubles!
[2024-01-19 17:16] <peter_shoes_> thank you both
[2024-01-19 17:16] <alcosta> For me the problem is solved but, for some other, the problem can repeat!
[2024-01-19 17:17] <tomreyn> alcosta: did you try booting from usb with the large resolution screen and the failsafe graphics option?
[2024-01-19 17:18] <alcosta> I tried something similar to boot with alternate option but.. I didn't know what to do with such an option!
[2024-01-19 17:19] <alcosta> What to do from a command line terminal for solving the problem!
[2024-01-19 17:21] <alcosta> The system was able to boot from disk (no more need for pen) without graphics but... what had i to do per solving the problem? Unplug the high resolution monitor and connect the low resolution one was very simple, but after some day of big troubles!
[2024-01-19 17:23] <tomreyn> alcosta: booting with the "failsafe graphics" option from the grub menu (first (text) menu showing) may work out for installing, and the installer should then automatically select the proprietary nvidia driver for installation, so you should be able to use the high dpi screen ine after installation. note, however, that 20.04 is getting a bit dated, the latest LTS release is 22.04, and its installaer may provide better support for your graphics
[2024-01-19 17:23] <tomreyn> card.
[2024-01-19 17:24] <tomreyn> alcosta: instead of spending 3 days to try to solve it, you're welcome to come here and discuss the details of the issue sooner in the future.
[2024-01-19 17:24] <alcosta> In my opinion, it's evident that ubuntu 20.04 can't boot, for the first time, from a large resolution monitor with a poor graphic card like nvidia geforce GT710!
[2024-01-19 17:25] <leftyfb> alcosta: did you try 22.04?
[2024-01-19 17:27] <alcosta> I'm very much engaged in developing a new app, with a great number of other problems! I tried to load ubuntu 22.04 but i found that, for the moment, 20.04 is better, because i know it a bit more!
[2024-01-19 17:28] <alcosta> With some features of 22.04 i was a bit unfit! (I don't remember well, now, with which particular feature, but i preferred to continue with 20.04.
[2024-01-19 17:30] <leftyfb> alcosta: ok, but you only have about 14 more months or so till 20.04 will be unsupported by the Ubuntu community
[2024-01-19 17:31] <alcosta> I'm coding the app in node.js, python and some other feature... it was unfit, for me, to reload all the libraries in a total new version of ubuntu or to mix the two versions!
[2024-01-19 17:32] <leftyfb> ok, so it sounds like you're painting yourself into a closet by only developing for aging libraries
[2024-01-19 17:32] <leftyfb> your call, it's just more work for you down the road
[2024-01-19 17:33] <alcosta> I was more confident to continue with the old version 20.04. I hope that in the next months i can try my app with new new version 22.04.
[2024-01-19 17:36] <alcosta> To mix coding the new app and testing the new features of 22.04 is not for me so comfortable!
[2024-01-19 17:36] <alcosta> One thing at a time, please!
[2024-01-19 17:37] <tomreyn> ok alcosta. do you need ubuntu support with anything else at this time?
[2024-01-19 17:39] <alcosta> I have some problem with launching google chrome from 20.04 version! After a new boot, the left bar is blinking for about 20 seconds! Subsequently, the is no other problem! Launching chrome after the first boot don't give any more problem! Is that solved with version 22.04 too?
[2024-01-19 17:40] <tomreyn> try using Chromium instead.
[2024-01-19 17:44] <alcosta> As mentioned before, I love my old habits! Is there a solution without changing Chrome for Chromium? (Whoever leaves the old path for the new one, knows what he leaves, he doesn't know what he may finds! (ancient Italian proverb))
[2024-01-19 17:45] <tomreyn> You'll need to ask Google about this.
[2024-01-19 17:46] <alcosta> Is there a google channel on libera.chat?
[2024-01-19 17:46] <tomreyn> (There is no Google Chrome package in Ubuntu, and most volunteers here will only be using the open source Chromium variant of this web browser.)

[2024-01-19 17:46] <ubottu> alcosta: Please see my private message

[2024-01-19 17:51] <mandem0110> alcosta: probably not, ubottu is a *bot*...
[2024-01-19 17:52] <alcosta> Any way, ok! I will survive to all these problems! I hope other people can survive too! :)
[2024-01-19 18:10] <alcosta> See you next time! :)
[2024-01-19 18:22] <alcosta> Any way, i know that in April 2024, the new version ubuntu 24 will be available! For the moment I prefer to skip version 22 and go directly to version 24. That is what i thought some months ago! Thank you every body! :)
[2024-01-19 18:45] <rfm> alcosta, in your planning, be aware that there will not be a direct 20.04>24.04 upgrade, and the upgrade to 24.04 from 22.05 won't be available until 24.04.1 ships around August 2024.
[2024-01-19 18:45] <rfm> alcosta, if you plan to simply back up your data and do a fresh install, the upgrade restrictions won't affect you.
[2024-01-19 18:50] <alcosta> rfm, thank you! In fact, I plan to back up my data and do a fresh install of version 24, preferably after some time of testing. :)
[2024-01-19 22:42] <cowars> Should I install Ubuntu 22 or 23?
[2024-01-19 22:42] <cowars> For daily driver desktop
[2024-01-19 22:42] <genii> LTS (22.04 )is probably the better choice in this case

[2024-01-20 04:40] <kotgc> Hello, I'm receiving this tar error https://dpaste.com/DXJKJW6PW
[2024-01-20 04:41] <kotgc> However, if I remove lines 9, 10, 13-15 this may not backup the disk which needs backup of its data?
[2024-01-20 04:48] <shadow255> kotgc: it appears that command intends *not* to include the non-existent targets. Eliminating the lines for them is a good thing if it allows your command to work.
[2024-01-20 05:27] <kotgc> shadow255 thank you for clarifying the code. I can move on to the next problem then, why does the OS backup not have these files? There is only sda1 which is EFI and sda2 which appears to be the OS.
[2024-01-20 05:47] <backthen> my flash drive is read only and I can't find ways to change it. Is it because the physical write-lock button is broken on it
[2024-01-20 06:09] <UndrWater_> backthen: from what i've read, it's because it's ready to be finished. reads, ok. writes. done.
[2024-01-20 06:24] <backthen> hmm looks like the issue is with this Access Control List
[2024-01-20 06:25] <UndrWater_> backthen: that's another possibility
[2024-01-20 06:26] <backthen> UndrWater_:  though I do also get the 'ready to be finished' issue for most disks. Though that's a separate issue largely I ignore
[2024-01-20 06:26] <backthen> for ACL I found a script to remove it and now I can write to the disk
[2024-01-20 06:29] <UndrWater_> backthen: congrats
[2024-01-20 06:41] <backthen> thanks. I want to make this SD card install with Ubuntu. Though I hear that will quickly damage the card
[2024-01-20 06:49] <UndrWater_> backthen: you want to install ubuntu on the SD card, or you want to use the SD card to install ubuntu?
[2024-01-20 06:57] <backthen> UndrWater_: the former. Ubuntu on the SD card and boot from it
[2024-01-20 06:58] <UndrWater_> yeah. better from a real drive, such as an ssd or spinny drive
[2024-01-20 06:59] <UndrWater_> you can use SD for boot. what are you installing on?
[2024-01-20 07:03] <backthen> a laptop. It's a 32G SD card I dont care if damaged. As long as I can use it for a year for simple work then I'm happy
[2024-01-20 07:07] <UndrWater_> backthen: if it's new, maybe it'll work. otherwise, maybe an ssd attached via usb?
[2024-01-20 07:15] <backthen> UndrWater_: I do have ssd via usb too, though it's bulky so I thought to give SD a try. I figure as long as I don't do lots of file io except the file io that occur inherently from ubuntu, then should last a while
[2024-01-20 07:17] <UndrWater_> it "might". which is the problem. backup. backup. backup.
[2024-01-20 07:17] <UndrWater_> otherwise. you're good!
[2024-01-20 07:18] <backthen> will do. It's nice to get some last use of this SD card that's otherwise falling apart physically
[2024-01-20 07:20] <UndrWater_> ;-)
[2024-01-20 07:24] <backthen> btw unrelated, I have another laptop that I boot via a Ubuntu usb drive with 'try ubuntu'. The ubuntu logo appears for a few minutes and eventually I get a terminal text message something like 'media creation failed', and then I'm asked to remove the usb drive and reboot. I guess that laptop has some issues?
[2024-01-20 07:30] <UndrWater_> backthen: i'd suspect the usb first. but perhaps you are correct
[2024-01-20 07:30] <UndrWater_> night time for me. good luck!
[2024-01-20 07:34] <backthen> thanks gn. The usb does work on other laptops. The problem laptop I figure may have ram or cpu issues
[2024-01-20 07:50] <realivanjx> hi. i am using ubuntu 23.10. after setting up wireguard using the cli, i noticed that the dns settings in the conf file isnt respected by the operating system (still uses the dns server from the wifi/router). i have to always manually change the dns server from the network settings gui. is there a way to make ubuntu to use the wireguard dns
[2024-01-20 07:50] <realivanjx> setting?
[2024-01-20 07:52] <alkisg> realivanjx: what's the output of `resolvectl`, does it list the DNS server under the wireguard link?
[2024-01-20 07:55] <realivanjx> alkisg: yes i can see the wireguard interface with the correct dns according to the conf file
[2024-01-20 07:55] <realivanjx> but when i use dig, it still hits the default ones on my laptop's wifi
[2024-01-20 07:56] <alkisg> Can you actually pastebin the output of resolvectl? Feel free to modify things for privacy if you like
[2024-01-20 07:56] <realivanjx> ok one sec
[2024-01-20 07:56] <alkisg> And, you want wireguard dns to be the dns for everything, or just for a certain domain?
[2024-01-20 07:57] <realivanjx> alkisg: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YcxvZHd7xK/
[2024-01-20 07:59] <realivanjx> alkisg: i want the wireguard's dns to be the dns for everything
[2024-01-20 07:59] <realivanjx> currently the wg's dns is completely ignored
[2024-01-20 08:01] <realivanjx> here is my wg client conf: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BpzDWsJ6gs/
[2024-01-20 08:08] <alkisg> realivanjx: did that use to work in the past? 23.10 has had some silly netplan changes, changing the network-manager file format. Also are you using network-manager?
[2024-01-20 08:08] <alkisg> Finally, why don't you put allowedips=0.0.0.0/0 if you want everything to go through the tunnel? I faintly remember that this made systemd-resolved apply the global dns setting then...
[2024-01-20 08:11] <realivanjx> because i only want to use my own dns
[2024-01-20 08:11] <realivanjx> i dont want the other traffic to go through the vpn
[2024-01-20 08:12] <realivanjx> alkisg: and no this is my first time setting this up on ubuntu
[2024-01-20 08:12] <alkisg> Are you using network-manager, e.g. does `nmcli con show` list the connection?
[2024-01-20 08:14] <realivanjx> im not really sure if i use network-manager or some other since i never touch those so it should use whatever is preconfigured with ubuntu 23. i can see the wifi connection on nmcli con show though
[2024-01-20 08:14] <alkisg> Do you also see the wireguard connection, i.e. have you imported it or are you just running it manually each time?
[2024-01-20 08:15] <realivanjx> yea it is also there. i only configured the wireguard via wg cli only
[2024-01-20 08:16] <alkisg> OK if you're running it manually and you don't want to use allowedips 0.0.0.0 (understandable) then I think you'll need something like this: https://www.procustodibus.com/blog/2022/03/wireguard-dns-config-for-systemd/#override-dns-globally
[2024-01-20 08:17] <realivanjx> ok thanks. do you have an idea to undo the PostUp command for the PostDown?
[2024-01-20 08:28] <realivanjx> nevermind. it seems that the actual problem is that the dns i set in the wireguard conf is not prioritized so the system still uses the wifi's. what is the command to disable dhcp's dns to put it in PostUp and revert that in PostDown.

[2024-01-20 13:32] <r_ha> Hey, Is there a way to use clonezilla from usb drive on aarch64?
[2024-01-20 13:48] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-20 13:50] <jeremy31> r_ha: You can install clonezilla on Ubuntu ISO on USB
[2024-01-20 13:52] <r_ha> but still, after trying to boot it i get nothing but black screen
[2024-01-20 13:59] <jeremy31> Is there any ISO that boots?
[2024-01-20 14:07] <r_ha> yes
[2024-01-20 14:07] <jeremy31> r_ha: what one?
[2024-01-20 14:18] <CosmicDJ> jeremy31: ubuntu-23.10.1-desktop-amd64.iso for example
[2024-01-20 19:36] <mra90> I have two devices connected to local WiFi one is a windows device and internet works fine but the other is Ubuntu laptop, connected to the same network but no internet or super super slow
[2024-01-20 19:36] <mra90> what maight be wrong here? Also, it used to work well
[2024-01-20 19:37] <mra90> when I ping that ubuntu laptop from windows I get: Ping statistics for 192.168.1.28:
[2024-01-20 19:37] <mra90>     Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 2, Lost = 2 (50% loss),
[2024-01-20 19:43] <bprompt> mra90: the WiFi coming from a local router you can access?
[2024-01-20 19:43] <mra90> bprompt, yes
[2024-01-20 19:43] <bprompt> mra90: tried restarting the router yet? so it does rediscovery of devices
[2024-01-20 19:44] <mra90> hmm that would disable internet for everybody in the building so I would rather do it as a last thing
[2024-01-20 19:44] <mra90> and also, no issue on windows
[2024-01-20 19:44] <bprompt> mra90: other than that, I'd try jogging the linux wifi driver, or a reinstallation of it
[2024-01-20 19:44] <mra90> so router itself is fine
[2024-01-20 19:44] <mra90> I tried to reboot ubuntu but no improvement
[2024-01-20 19:45] <mra90> It even shows the network signal strength is "Good"
[2024-01-20 19:47] <bprompt> mra90: you could try -> https://devicetests.com/uninstall-reinstall-wifi-drivers-ubuntu <-
[2024-01-20 19:47] <bprompt> mra90: what I can think of, is some library issue
[2024-01-20 20:26] <calamari> I'd like to set up Ubuntu 22.04 as a WPA2/3 secured Wi-Fi hotspot, with a host IP of my choosing, such that an Apple iPad (specifically) will connect to it and can communicate with the host. I've been able to accomplish some of these things, but not all at once. For example, choosing the host IP was a problem, and getting the iPad to see it as a valid connection was also a problem. Anyone accomplished this before?
[2024-01-20 20:30] <toddc> calamari: not really a ubuntu issue but all of those should be able to be done but 50% router IE is the router setup for static and is it a availible ip address on the router
[2024-01-20 20:34] <calamari> toddc: They should be yes, as OpenWRT seems to be capable of it. Not sure how to accomplish it in Ubuntu tho. I suspect NetworkManager is to blame, but I'm not sure.
[2024-01-20 20:36] <calamari> toddc: also, just to clear up any confusion: there is no router, just a pc and ipad, both with wifi.
[2024-01-20 20:38] <calamari> Android seemed quite happy to connect (albiet with the wrong host IP due to it being hardcoded in NM), but iPad not so much
[2024-01-20 20:39] <calamari> I suppose I could try recompiling netowrk manager to change the IP, unless I'm wrong and it's actually somewhere else like the kernel
[2024-01-20 20:39] <calamari> I guess that's where I'll start
[2024-01-20 20:42] <toddc> calamari: I suspect you are folloing a oder wifi hotspot guide but atthe moment I cannot test at right now but a static IP can and should be set in the hotspot tool in network manager it will be differnt for each connection wired and or wifi
[2024-01-20 20:42] <toddc> older
[2024-01-20 20:44] <toddc> looking at the guide it just connects wired to wireless and passes the ip to the wired network https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/net-wireless-adhoc.html.en
[2024-01-20 21:19] <jeremy31> calamari: Check out https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot
[2024-01-20 21:30] <lch> anyone home
[2024-01-20 21:31] <CosmicDJ> lch: depends
[2024-01-20 21:31] <lch> why does usb-creator-gtk run forever when creating the usb stick from an iso image?
[2024-01-20 22:18] <calamari> jeremy31: at least the GUI shown on the GitHub README doesn't seem to have a host IP address setting. Is it in there somewhere?
[2024-01-20 22:37] <ruser> hello, how do i find which package is providing libxcb-errors?  I'm trying to build sway from src but  can't seem to meet this dependency.
[2024-01-20 22:37] <rbox> apt-file can tell you what package something is in
[2024-01-20 22:37] <calamari> jeremy31: Yes it does, and it seems to work.. Thanks a lot!
[2024-01-20 22:38] <ruser> rbox: oh, nice. does it require a package to be installed on the system to find?
[2024-01-20 22:39] <rbox> no
[2024-01-20 22:39] <rbox> if it was installed you could just use dpkg
[2024-01-20 22:39] <ruser> thank you
[2024-01-20 23:13] <yuvraj> :)
[2024-01-21 00:18] <aiena> I have a tiny query I like Qterminal but since I am on ubuntu I have gnome-terminal there by default both the icons are identical is there a way to give Qterminal/konsole etc different terminal icons
[2024-01-21 00:21] <rbox> icons where
[2024-01-21 00:32] <aiena> rbox, in gnome and system wide
[2024-01-21 00:37] <rbox> meaning where...
[2024-01-21 00:37] <aiena> one sec
[2024-01-21 00:37] <aiena> everywhere when Isearch for the terminal and when i pin it to the application launcher
[2024-01-21 00:39] <rbox> why do you have both on the laucnher
[2024-01-21 00:40] <aiena> sometimes I like one over the other but I want to visually distinguish them by icon
[2024-01-21 00:40] <rbox> you switch?
[2024-01-21 00:40] <rbox> lol
[2024-01-21 00:41] <rbox> the desktop file is in /usr/share/applications
[2024-01-21 00:41] <aiena> yeah gnome trminal is cool purple konsole I think I'll remove
[2024-01-21 00:41] <rbox> copy it to ~/.local/share/applications
[2024-01-21 00:41] <rbox> and change the icon to wahtever you want
[2024-01-21 00:41] <rbox> hgow many termianls do you need
[2024-01-21 00:41] <rbox> lol
[2024-01-21 00:41] <aiena> qterminal is neat discovered it in a lubuntu vm
[2024-01-21 00:43] <aiena> rbox, https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/6a50db5c7733 lol
[2024-01-21 00:43] <rbox> why do you need to search
[2024-01-21 00:43] <rbox> if you've pinnned it
[2024-01-21 00:43] <aiena> guake has a unique terminal wanted to make differnt others all show up as one gnome style one
[2024-01-21 00:44] <aiena> rbox, its not pinned yet want to pin bith but its a nightmare
[2024-01-21 00:44] <aiena> they look identical
[2024-01-21 00:47] <aiena> maybe its not possible to give a custom icon but I hope it is
[2024-01-21 00:48] <rbox> ijust told you how
[2024-01-21 00:48] <rbox> but you just run the one you want
[2024-01-21 00:48] <rbox> pin it
[2024-01-21 00:48] <rbox> and call it a day
[2024-01-21 00:48] <aiena> copy it to ~/.local/share/applications yes but I dont know from where to copy it to there
[2024-01-21 00:49] <rbox> [05:41:09 PM] <rbox> the desktop file is in /usr/share/applications
[2024-01-21 00:50] <aiena> sorry I missed that
[2024-01-21 01:51] <loswedseded> is there a tone generation application for ubuntu?
[2024-01-21 01:51] <loswedseded> like https://onlinetonegenerator.com/
[2024-01-21 01:51] <loswedseded> downloadable and no internet reliant I mean
[2024-01-21 01:52] <rbox> what do you want to do with the tone once you've generated it
[2024-01-21 01:54] <aiena> thanks rbox works beautifully
[2024-01-21 02:02] <aiena> loswedseded, I think audacity can easily generate a tone for you
[2024-01-21 02:03] <aiena> I used to use it for that and much more
[2024-01-21 02:03] <aiena> its pretty good
[2024-01-21 02:05] <JanC> audacity can do it indeed
[2024-01-21 02:05] <JanC> probably effect plugins for many other audio editors too
[2024-01-21 02:05] <JanC> or for Jack
[2024-01-21 02:08] <JanC> there is also a package named 'siggen'
[2024-01-21 02:09] <JanC> that one is for the commandline
[2024-01-21 02:11] <aiena> ok not tried those. Audacity was cross platform and was enough for all my needs for audio cleaning cutting joining etc.
[2024-01-21 02:12] <aiena> I admit I dont do much tone generation but did use to to test filters etc.
[2024-01-21 02:12] <aiena> with predictable input
[2024-01-21 02:13] <JanC> yes, Audacity is quite easy to use (although I think it still doesn't support PulseAudio properly?)
[2024-01-21 02:14] <JanC> it's been a while since I used it to be fair
[2024-01-21 10:26] <zeprox> Hi! I'm having trouble getting my bluetooth headset to work. I have no input in headset mode, if I switch to handsfree mode i have no input or output.
[2024-01-21 11:21] <beast5678> hey
[2024-01-21 12:40] <tripstah> this any good? https://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair-cd/home/Home/  or are there better alternatives?
[2024-01-21 12:48] <EriC^^> tripstah: it's good
[2024-01-21 12:49] <EriC^^> do you have a problem with booting right now?
[2024-01-21 12:50] <tripstah> nope, but have had a few times before. now's good.
[2024-01-21 12:51] <EriC^^> ok cool
[2024-01-21 12:51] <tripstah> just in case... :-)
[2024-01-21 12:51] <EriC^^> gotcha ;)
[2024-01-21 13:24] <tier> h
[2024-01-21 13:25] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-21 14:09] <BinarySavior> how can I have ubuntu logged in by default when OS is booted up?
[2024-01-21 14:10] <Paris> in the setting panel
[2024-01-21 14:10] <Paris> must be in account/user auto loggin
[2024-01-21 14:10] <Paris> something like that.
[2024-01-21 14:18] <nodemxu84> exit
[2024-01-21 15:36] <phryk> I just set up ubuntu 22.04 in a vm. this is my first linux in over 10 years (my daily driver being freebsd). i gave this vm a virtual disk of 40gb and told the setup to use the entire disk. but when i `df -h` i can see that just above half of the disk seems to actually be used â what's up with that?
[2024-01-21 15:37] <phryk> no disk encryption/signatures used, so i expected it to actually get 40g of space, not 80% of that, definitely not just half of itâ¦
[2024-01-21 15:38] <ravage> phryk: Ubuntu Server?
[2024-01-21 15:39] <phryk> yes. also just stumbled onto https://bugs.launchpad.net/subiquity/+bug/1907128 seems to have been an active decision and that the topic i have to read up on is lvm.
[2024-01-21 15:40] <ravage> yes i think you have to resize it manually atm
[2024-01-21 15:40] <phryk> weird, but hey, snapshots are apparently a thing and since i don't want to deal with a full-blown offsite backup solution just yet, i guess i know what my interim solution will be. :P
[2024-01-21 15:47] <ravage> it is a stupid default.  i think you can do manual partitioning to get around it
[2024-01-21 15:48] <ravage> also it is just misleading. "use entire disk" is just not what is does
[2024-01-21 15:50] <pavlos> phryk: this alias will show you first level dirs ... alias big='sudo du -d1 -ah / | sort  -rh'
[2024-01-21 16:13] <phryk> pavlos: i don't see the relevance of that. i don't have a problem figuring out what uses how much space.
[2024-01-21 16:24] <PeGaSuS> so, I'm a bit angry with the "lets make everything as a snap". firefox snap refuses to start, for some unknown reason and if I try to start it from command line I get a "(crashreporter:329271): IBUS-WARNING **: 17:23:24.649: Failed to mkdir /home/vitor/snap/firefox/3626/.config/ibus/bus: Not a directory". same happens with Chromium
[2024-01-21 16:26] <PeGaSuS> the command `ps x | grep -v grep | grep firefox` returns no output which means no instance is running
[2024-01-21 16:30] <PeGaSuS> I'll reinstall it and see. but really makes little sense (and don't come with the "security" thing) to turn things that we used for decades as binaries into snaps.
[2024-01-21 16:37] <Bibbles> Sinds de laatste kernel upgrade naar 6.5.0 in 33.04.3 vliegen de errors en warnings me rond de oren. Hebben meer mensen hier problemen mee? Voorlopig ben ik maar even terug naar kernel 6.2
[2024-01-21 16:37] <Bibbles> Ik bedoel versie 22.04.3
[2024-01-21 16:38] <Bibbles> O, sorry. This is the english channel ofcourse. My bad...
[2024-01-21 16:40] <arraybolt3> PeGaSuS: Meh, the "security" thing was the whole point :P If you dislike it though, you can always uninstall the Snap and replace it with the Mozilla PPA or the upstream Firefox tarball. (I use the tarball on a slow, low-disk-space machine that doesn't cope with the Snap so well.)
[2024-01-21 16:40] <PeGaSuS> I tried to remove and install the snap again and it still doesn't even start
[2024-01-21 16:41] <arraybolt3> PeGaSuS: You can probably go into /home/vitor/snap/Firefox/3626/.config, then `stat ibus` and see if it's a file rather than a directory for some reason
[2024-01-21 16:41] <arraybolt3> and if it's a directory, then `cd ibus; stat bus`
[2024-01-21 16:41] <arraybolt3> and if *that's* a file rather than a directory, `mv bus bus.oldweirdwhatisthis; mkdir bus` and try again
[2024-01-21 16:42] <ioria> maybe a broken link to current
[2024-01-21 16:43] <PeGaSuS> yeah. `bus` seems to be a symlink: https://0bin.xyz/raw/X3JYYRX7ENTD7ZBXCD6TWRXS3M
[2024-01-21 16:44] <ioria> i'd try to copy over the content of ~/.config/ibus/bus/ , but idk really
[2024-01-21 16:47] <PeGaSuS> ls ~/.config/ibus/bus >> ls: cannot access '/home/vitor/.config/ibus/bus': No such file or directory
[2024-01-21 16:48] <PeGaSuS> not even `~/.config/ibus/` exists
[2024-01-21 16:49] <ioria> that should exist
[2024-01-21 16:49] <PeGaSuS> for some weird reason it doesn't. and the pc is been up for the last 4 days
[2024-01-21 16:50] <PeGaSuS> I can reboot, but I wonder if that fixes anything
[2024-01-21 16:57] <Bibbles> Hello everyone. Ever since my 22.04.3 system upgraded tot kernel 6.5.0 I'm getting a lot of errors and warnings during startup about "array-index-out-of-bounds" etc. Also some of my hardware doesn't seem te be working with this new kernel. So, eventually I quit trying to fix this and reverted back to kernel 6.2 Does anyone expericence the same and can/will this be fixed?
[2024-01-21 16:57] <PeGaSuS> after a reboot I was able to start Firefox but `/home/vitor/snap/firefox/3626/.config/ibus/bus` is a file and not a dir. `~/.config/ibus/` still doesn't exist
[2024-01-21 17:00] <rbox> Bibbles: sounds like you should file a bug report
[2024-01-21 17:00] <Bibbles> rbox: Probably. I've been searching for this and a see a lot of bug reports from various distributions thata are experiencing the same issues.
[2024-01-21 17:01] <rbox> okay well if there isn't one in the ubuntu bug tracker
[2024-01-21 17:01] <Bibbles> rbox: seriously?
[2024-01-21 17:02] <rbox> well if its a kernel bug, you can just wait and maybe it'll get fixed if its the same as these other random bug reports
[2024-01-21 17:02] <rbox> if its not a kernel bug, well then, it probably wont magically fix itself
[2024-01-21 17:04] <alkisg> Bibbles: is the device using an in-kernel driver, or an out-of-tree one? Btw, you can also uninstall the -hwe kernel and use the generic 5.15 one
[2024-01-21 17:04] <Bibbles> rbox: It's probably a kernel bug. I'm looking at reports like this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta-hwe-6.5/+bug/2049317
[2024-01-21 17:06] <rbox> well if there is arelad ya bug report
[2024-01-21 17:06] <rbox> then just followi t and see
[2024-01-21 17:07] <phryk> i'm trying to get mssql running on 22.04. which as per ms is the latest supported version and seems to be the best choice because it's an lts release. however the setup (mssql-conf setup) fails when trying to run sqlservr, which crashes.
[2024-01-21 17:07] <phryk> error output is less than helpful, but seems to indicate it's trying to open a file that doesn't exist (cause: 6, last errno: 22).
[2024-01-21 17:08] <rbox> sounds like a question for microsoft
[2024-01-21 17:08] <phryk> running sqlservr through strace it looks like it's trying to open /sys/block/dm-0/device/scsi_disk â this exists up to dm-0, but the entire 'device' directory does not exist â can somebody clear up what this file would be and why it might not exist on my system?
[2024-01-21 17:08] <phryk> rbox: there's a microsoft channel? tried #mssql but it's almost empty, doesn't even have a topic and is very dead. :P
[2024-01-21 17:08] <Bibbles> alkisg: The device is my network device. Normally it is supported with r8169, which is in-kernel. But the 6.5.0 doesn't work well and causes all sorts of weird behaviours. So I tried installing the r8168-dkms from repo. But that one didn't install. So eventually I had to recomplie a new .deb that is suited for 6.5.0 kernel. That one works. So that is one problem less. I still battle with screens full of warnings about "array-index-out-o
[2024-01-21 17:08] <Bibbles> -bounds".
[2024-01-21 17:20] <alkisg> Bibbles: if the UBSAN warnings are from the external .deb (not in ubuntu repositories), then you need to ask them to update it
[2024-01-21 17:20] <alkisg> If they're from another, in-kernel driver, pastebin a couple of lines so that we can see from which driver it is
[2024-01-21 17:20] <alkisg> And note once more that it's a supported use case to use the 5.15 kernel; while 6.2 isn't maintained anymore in 22.04
[2024-01-21 17:23] <Bibbles> alkisg: These are allthe kernels on my system: linux-image-6.2.0-26-generic, linux-image-6.5.0-14-generic, linux-image-generic-hwe-22.04
[2024-01-21 17:23] <Bibbles> Should I install the 5.15 manually?
[2024-01-21 17:24] <alkisg> Bibbles: sudo apt install linux-generic
[2024-01-21 17:24] <alkisg> Then reboot and select 5.15 in grub; THEN remove the 6.2 kernel
[2024-01-21 17:25] <Bibbles> Ok. So the linux-generic will install the 5.15 kernel?
[2024-01-21 17:25] <alkisg> Yes, it's the metapackage that installs the kernel and keeps it up to date with updates
[2024-01-21 17:26] <Bibbles> alkisg: But wouldn't that be a big step back? Or is 5.15 what the 22.04 version started out with in the first place?
[2024-01-21 17:27] <alkisg> Bibbles: ubuntu LTS releases maintain two series of kernels, the "stable" one and the "hardware enablement" one; all servers and all 22.04.0 installations have the "stable" one, while the rest ones have the hwe one
[2024-01-21 17:28] <alkisg> So if you don't have some newer hardware that can't run on 5.15, then no, it's not a step back; you just give time to your dkms.deb developer to catch up with newer kernels
[2024-01-21 17:29] <Bibbles> alkisg: I see. Thanks for that information! Much appriciated! But for the time being it's still ok to use the 6.5 or the 6.2 I guess? Maybe lateron, If I stay on 22.04, I can install 5.15 and use that kernel.
[2024-01-21 17:31] <Bibbles> I just did a clean install with the latest Xubuntu 22.04.3 and it installs 6.5 out of the box.
[2024-01-21 17:32] <alkisg> Bibbles: if the driver works then sure you can keep using 6.5. Don't use 6.2 it won't receive updates in 22.04. And yes, 22.04.3 comes with the -hwe kernel. That doesn't mean 5.15 is bad or unmaintained.
[2024-01-21 17:33] <Bibbles> alkisg: I understand. Thanks again for the help and info! I will probably have to move back to 5.15 then.
[2024-01-21 18:55] <cart_man> Hi eveyrone. I downloaded the Ubuntu-touch repo but tere is no code in that repo. How do I pull the actual code?
[2024-01-21 19:11] <szstr> ah-ble' keh-dara:   How do u login to phpmyadmin with database creation abilities?
[2024-01-21 19:12] <szstr> I need to set mysql user phpmyadmin to be able to create databases?
[2024-01-21 19:14] <bprompt> szstr:  hmmm you could try asking at #php
[2024-01-21 20:34] <jsmooth> A couple of months ago I installed Ubuntu to a flash drive. At first I got grub shell, rebooted to get desktop, now I keep getting grub shell. Is there any ideas as to what happened that causes this
[2024-01-21 20:35] <rbox> some configuration file for grub got corrupted
[2024-01-21 20:36] <jsmooth> Is the fix to just reinstall Ubuntu (including full format) again?
[2024-01-21 20:37] <rbox> that would probably work
[2024-01-21 20:37] <jsmooth> Is there something that doesn't require a full reinstall?
[2024-01-21 20:38] <rbox> you could try fixing grub
[2024-01-21 20:39] <bprompt> jsmooth: when you exit the LiveUSB session, do  you shut it down or simply turn off the computer?
[2024-01-21 20:39] <jsmooth> I would imagine I would shut it down first.
[2024-01-21 20:39] <jsmooth> Wouldn't it be dangerous to just turn off the power?
[2024-01-21 20:40] <bprompt> jsmooth: yeap, if however you happen to poweroff the computer or interrupt the shutdown process, the session gets corrupted and good chances it won't load next time, or something like might happen
[2024-01-21 20:40] <bprompt> jsmooth: just checking if that's what happened
[2024-01-21 20:40] <jsmooth> JHmm.
[2024-01-21 20:40] <alkisg> jsmooth: can you boot the liveusb now? Or you can't get past the grub prompt?
[2024-01-21 20:41] <bprompt> jsmooth: it only has to happen once btw, to get corrupted
[2024-01-21 20:41] <jsmooth> ACtually, no, because somehow the usb is failing. WIndows says I have to format it but if I try it says it's write-protected\
[2024-01-21 20:41] <alkisg> It sounds like the flash drive got worn out and got itself to read-only mode
[2024-01-21 20:42] <jsmooth> IT's brand-new
[2024-01-21 20:42] <alkisg> Didn't you say a couple of months ago?
[2024-01-21 20:42] <alkisg> If you put a non-live OS in a usb drive, it causes too many writes, it can damage it in a couple of months
[2024-01-21 20:43] <jsmooth> Hmm. I guess it ruined it in 5 reboots
[2024-01-21 20:43] <oerheks> unless that usb is an NVME..
[2024-01-21 20:44] <jsmooth> I don't know, it's a 64GB ONN Flash Drive, best info I have.
[2024-01-21 20:44] <alkisg> jsmooth: just try to format it, if you can't, then send it back, it should still be in warranty after just 2 months
[2024-01-21 20:44] <jsmooth> I don't think I registered a warranty
[2024-01-21 20:45] <oerheks> run chkdsk on windows first?
[2024-01-21 20:45] <ioria> jsmooth, can't you start it from the bios menu ? does it show there ?
[2024-01-21 20:45] <bprompt> jsmooth: not trying to be bashful, ONN is a bit of a generic brand
[2024-01-21 20:45] <jsmooth> I tried to format the usb, it said it's write-protected. The other USB i bought within a week of this one has done the same thing to me, it was the usb I used for the Ubuntu installer.
[2024-01-21 20:46] <bprompt> jsmooth: btw, at first I thought you were meaning a liveusb session, as opposed to a full install to usb, anyhow
[2024-01-21 20:46] <jsmooth> The other drive is live iso, but this one had the actual installation on it.
[2024-01-21 20:47] <Maik> If the sticks are read only you probably can throw them away. Installing a OS on flash drives isn't really recommended.
[2024-01-21 20:47] <bprompt> jsmooth: hmmm I still have my old Sandisk 4Gbs stick, running a LiveUSB of 20.04 just fine btw, even used it for 16.04 back then, still works
[2024-01-21 20:47] <jsmooth> Hmm. I was a suggestion from an engineer, so I did it.
[2024-01-21 20:48] <Maik> the read write count is far less so not such a good suggestion
[2024-01-21 20:48] <alkisg> I've switched to sandisk sd cards for my raspberries, they were the most resilient of all the brands I've tried
[2024-01-21 20:48] <bprompt> jsmooth: as I said, ONN is a bit of a generic brand, you'd want heavy reliability for lots of data I/O
[2024-01-21 20:49] <jsmooth> Okay. I guess I shouldn't have bought a cheap one
[2024-01-21 20:49] <bprompt> jsmooth: if you want my biased, Samsung is tops, or Sandisk
[2024-01-21 20:49] <jsmooth> I'll keep that in mind
[2024-01-21 20:50] <bprompt> jsmooth: and nevermind the price
[2024-01-21 20:50] <jsmooth> Thanks
[2024-01-21 21:34] <TomyLobo> I'm on ubuntu 22.04, I'm trying lxd for the first time. setting up a container worked and i'm now trying to forward all traffic going to one of my ipv6 IPs to it. From remote, I only get timeouts. From the host, it works. UFW logs a block, here are the details: https://gist.github.com/TomyLobo/39d4d24fe0fe1f58a9f399aa35367946
[2024-01-21 21:35] <TomyLobo> I've been at this for hours, I can't figure out how to unblock this
[2024-01-21 22:02] <lunatiq> anyone familiar with Ombi? I'm trying to update it but having trouble. I copy the tar from github of the latest version. I cp the working directory to another to back it up. I remove the old. I mkdir a new one. I wget the gz. I tar -xzvf and try to start it but it doesn't start.
[2024-01-21 22:03] <rbox> "it doesnt start" doesnt say anything
[2024-01-21 22:04] <lunatiq> rbox I don't know what else to say. I'm not a Ubuntu pro.
[2024-01-21 22:05] <lunatiq> I use systemctl to start it and stop it
[2024-01-21 22:05] <lunatiq> I can copy the backup and start it back up and it works
[2024-01-21 22:34] <TomyLobo> lunatiq, instead of "it doesn't start", post the error, if there is one. if there is no output at all, say that, along with the output you would expect, or what else leads you to conclude that "it doesn't start"
[2024-01-21 22:37] <lunatiq> TomyLobo I check ps aux. After initiating systemctl start ombi it goes to the next line like there was no issue but it isn't started.
[2024-01-21 22:37] <lunatiq> I get 502 bad gateway too
[2024-01-21 22:38] <lunatiq> I don't receive any error or a notice to check logs.
[2024-01-21 22:39] <TomyLobo> what does "systemctl status ombi" say?
[2024-01-21 22:40] <TomyLobo> btw for the majority of services, all "systemctl start ombi" does is launch the process and whatever else happens after it is none of its business
[2024-01-21 22:40] <TomyLobo> that's why it instantly goes back to the command prompt
[2024-01-21 22:42] <lunatiq> Let me try the process again and see what it says
[2024-01-21 22:43] <TomyLobo> you could just look at "systemctl status ombi" :)
[2024-01-21 22:43] <TomyLobo> also, journalctl -u ombi
[2024-01-21 22:44] <lunatiq> https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/3f70fc8a079f4829ae710c8b647eb688
[2024-01-21 22:44] <TomyLobo> btw, tell the authors of whatever "ombi" is, to make a package or a snap or a container image or something, cause handing people a tarball isn't really great
[2024-01-21 22:46] <lunatiq> I understand
[2024-01-21 22:46] <TomyLobo> ok so it exited with status 203. that doesn't tell us much, unless that's documented somewhere. but let's check the journal first (journalctl -u ombi). and see if port 3000 is already in use for some reason (netstat -nap | grep :3000)
[2024-01-21 22:48] <TomyLobo> lunatiq, what's the output of "file /opt/Ombi/Ombi"?
[2024-01-21 23:31] <SuperLag> Is there a way to perform the LTS install with the 6.x kernel right from the outset? or do you have to install normally and update later?
[2024-01-21 23:34] <oerheks> SuperLag, if you install LTS now, you would get HWE automatic, so yes you can
[2024-01-21 23:34] <oerheks> !hwe
[2024-01-21 23:34] <ubottu> The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
[2024-01-22 00:07] <shoreditch-samur> hi all, how often do you upgrade your kernel? I'm using mainline (https://github.com/bkw777/mainline) and upgrade my kernel once every 2-3 weeks. It's probably a bit excessive.
[2024-01-22 00:09] <rbox> sounds like you should jsut stick to the kernel ubuntu provides
[2024-01-22 00:09] <rbox> and update it whne there is an update
[2024-01-22 00:09] <oerheks> +1
[2024-01-22 00:10] <oerheks> mainline are experimental builds, thanks for testing
[2024-01-22 00:11] <shoreditch-samur> right-o, thanks

[2024-01-22 00:52] <RaimondRaj> what does this means
[2024-01-22 00:54] <mybalzitch> it means run that command to find out why it won't start
[2024-01-22 00:59] <RaimondRaj> if i know why is not run then why should i ask here.. be fore advice people ur brain to think and read carefully the question
[2024-01-22 01:03] <rbox> RaimondRaj: you asked "what does this mean"... and the answer is "it means run the command that output is telling you to run"

[2024-01-22 08:46] <alkisg> *via password, sorry
[2024-01-22 08:46] <alkisg> Did you use ssh-copy-id, or did you just manually create authorized_keys?

[2024-01-22 14:17] <leftyfb> wyre: Ubuntu 12.04 was released over 10 years ago. It's completely unsupported. Do not use it.
[2024-01-22 14:18] <wyre> leftyfb, sure but my workmates don't agree with that ...
[2024-01-22 14:19] <wyre> so I'm trying to boot a Ubuntu 12 live media in a UEFI system and ... it doesn't apaprently support it
[2024-01-22 14:19] <leftyfb> wyre: sorry to hear that. There's absoultely no reason Ubuntu 12.04 should still be used in production today. Time to upgrade
[2024-01-22 14:19] <leftyfb> wyre: do not install it. Install 22.04
[2024-01-22 14:28] <Anjor> Your workmates are morons.
[2024-01-22 14:28] <leftyfb> Anjor: that's unnecessary. Please don't do that

[2024-01-22 14:33] <mrblack> maybe his just trolling with that question? im having abit of troubles running cgi on my apache, think iv added the scriptalias directive to the virltual host file and restarted but with no luck im getting url isnt found on this server.....
[2024-01-22 14:34] <mrblack> bit unsure what to do, got any tips?
[2024-01-22 14:34] <leftyfb> mrblack: there might be more targeted support for your issue in #ubuntu-server or #apache
[2024-01-22 14:34] <mrblack> oh sorry wrong place. haha been 20 years since i used irc
[2024-01-22 14:57] <cart_> Hello everyone. Is there a FileSystem that is encrypted and uses decryption on file reads?
[2024-01-22 14:57] <cart_> or writes for that matter
[2024-01-22 15:02] <leftyfb> cart_: I hope not
[2024-01-22 15:04] <mrreboot> hi guys
[2024-01-22 15:04] <mrreboot> what is this
[2024-01-22 15:12] <cart_> leftyfb: Why not? How does encrypting your disc in linux work if you select it in the setup?
[2024-01-22 15:13] <leftyfb> cart_: the volume is encrypted, you decrypt it at boot
[2024-01-22 15:13] <cart_> leftyfb: But surely not the entire disc?
[2024-01-22 15:14] <leftyfb> hence the term Full Disk Encryption
[2024-01-22 15:14] <leftyfb> you can chose to encrypt the entire disk or not
[2024-01-22 15:15] <cart_> leftyfb: Ok sorry what I mean is, When you encrypt the disc surely it decrypts as it reads?
[2024-01-22 15:15] <cart_> You give the key. It then stores the decrypted key which it then uses to access files or write files
[2024-01-22 15:15] <cart_> If I am not mistaken
[2024-01-22 15:16] <cart_> Because decrypting the entire drive on startup sounds wild
[2024-01-22 15:16] <ravage> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup
[2024-01-22 15:16] <leftyfb> ravage: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/encrypting-drives-using-LUKS/#:~:text=LUKS%20uses%20the%20kernel%20device,use%20of%20the%20cryptsetup%20utility.
[2024-01-22 15:17] <ravage> ?
[2024-01-22 15:18] <leftyfb> sorry, that was meant for cart_
[2024-01-22 15:21] <ravage> So it does not decrypt all data on mount of course. You get a new device that represents the decrypted state and blocks are de- and encrypted when needed
[2024-01-22 15:21] <ravage> But it is in no way file basedÂ
[2024-01-22 15:25] <cart_> leftyfb: So when using LUKS. How easy is it to get the keys that are required to access the disc when the machine is on and you are the admin?
[2024-01-22 15:25] <cart_> ravage: Right ok that is what I had in mind yes
[2024-01-22 15:26] <cart_> ravage: Basically there is a key between the OS and the FS and somewhere the blocks get decrypted and encrypted as whatever they contain is needed
[2024-01-22 15:26] <cart_> ?
[2024-01-22 15:26] <leftyfb> cart_: what exactly is your ubuntu support question? If you're looking to debate or learn the level of security LUKS provides, I would recommend asking in #security
[2024-01-22 15:26] <cart_> leftyfb: Holy shit I did not actually knew that channel exists. Thanks!
[2024-01-22 15:28] <TomyWork> since upgrading to kubuntu 22.04 from 18.04, ssh-agent keeps asking me to confirm the use of the key. I don't think it really adds any security, so can I turn that off somehow? :)
[2024-01-22 16:11] <ghostbuster> is there a way to upgrade qemu beyond 4.2 in focal? jammy has 6.2
[2024-01-22 16:15] <leftyfb> !latest | ghostbuster
[2024-01-22 16:15] <ubottu> ghostbuster: Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[2024-01-22 16:17] <leftyfb> ghostbuster: there are ways, though aren't really supported here
[2024-01-22 16:17] <leftyfb> compile, PPA, some community-maintained snap package
[2024-01-22 16:18] <leftyfb> ghostbuster: is there a particular feature you need that isn't available in 4.2?
[2024-01-22 16:19] <wyre> leftyfb, the problem is we have a system with Ubuntu 12.04 booting in UEFI mode ... but we are not sure why using this KVM adapter https://www.kvm-switches-online.com/mpuiq-vmcdp.html just keyboard works
[2024-01-22 16:20] <wyre> xinput shows also a mouse core pointer for the adapter
[2024-01-22 16:20] <wyre> but it's not working ...
[2024-01-22 16:20] <wyre> so not sure if you could give me some idea about what could I check
[2024-01-22 16:20] <leftyfb> wyre: upgrade to a release that was released in the last 10 years
[2024-01-22 16:21] <leftyfb> 20.04 or 22.04. The latter being the recommended path
[2024-01-22 16:25] <ghostbuster> leftyfb: i think i'm hitting this bug https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=918950
[2024-01-22 17:06] <Haris_> hello all
[2024-01-22 17:06] <Haris_> how do I initialize mysqld with custom datadir for first time run?
[2024-01-22 17:07] <ravage> i would keep the datadir and mount it or use a bind mount
[2024-01-22 17:08] <Haris_> mount? disk vol is ready. configured in apparmor as well
[2024-01-22 17:08] <Haris_> mysql restart gives error
[2024-01-22 17:09] <Haris_> mysql-systemd-start[455734]: MySQL system database not found in /custom/mysqld/datadir/path. Please run mysqld --initialize.
[2024-01-22 17:09] <Haris_> mysqld --initialize does nothing
[2024-01-22 17:09] <Haris_> 8.0.19 stock from ubuntu repo for focal
[2024-01-22 17:10] <ravage> if this is a new system focal is not the system i would start with
[2024-01-22 17:10] <ravage> get jammy
[2024-01-22 17:10] <Haris_> can't change the OS version in the short term. will look into it
[2024-01-22 17:11] <Haris_> on first look .. jammay is the same version though
[2024-01-22 17:12] <Haris_> do-release-upgrade?
[2024-01-22 17:12] <ravage> you can do that. or do a fresh install
[2024-01-22 17:12] <ravage> and by mount i mean something like:
[2024-01-22 17:12] <ravage> tank/mysql-data        179G   17G  162G  10% /var/lib/mysql
[2024-01-22 17:12] <ravage> tank/mysql-log         167G  4,4G  162G   3% /var/log/mysql
[2024-01-22 17:13] <ravage> so you mount the storage you want to use to the default locations
[2024-01-22 17:14] <Haris_> don't want the default locations. have it working on another box. just need to finish on this one
[2024-01-22 17:17] <Haris_> I think I found the problem
[2024-01-22 17:19] <Haris_> E: Unable to locate package sg3_utils
[2024-01-22 17:35] <Haris_> how can I verify my custom paths for mysql config are whitelisted in apparmor config? is there a way to syntax check or dump its config for a single app?
[2024-01-22 17:38] <Haris_> please ignore. all good
[2024-01-22 17:44] <Haris_> how to safely upgrade to jammy? its a brand new VM. but can't re-do the VM in short term. it took a lot of work to bring it this far
[2024-01-22 17:54] <Haris_> mysqld --initialize didn't create all the system tables. what extra params go with it?
[2024-01-22 17:56] <Haris_> https://dpaste.com/4P275VXSB
[2024-01-22 18:09] <ll8> quaquaqua
[2024-01-22 20:09] <nshirelaptop> is it possible to unmount / after booting so I can expand its partition?
[2024-01-22 20:09] <nshirelaptop> or can this only be done from something like live media
[2024-01-22 20:09] <nshirelaptop> *liveusb
[2024-01-22 20:13] <bprompt> nshirelaptop: hmmm I'd do it from a live session, much safer
[2024-01-22 20:13] <nshirelaptop> yeah, I'll wait till I get home where I have a usb install disk and importantly, a laptop charger

[2024-01-23 03:33] <morgan-u2> The pocket drive has a light on it that flashes about every 3 secs.
[2024-01-23 03:35] <lotuspsychje> morgan-u2: journalctl -f and plug in your usb, to see verbose errors on your device, share in a !paste with the volunteers so they cna have a look
[2024-01-23 03:39] <morgan-u2> I dont quite understand. Re my pocket drive. I should remove it. Then give the command jorunalctl -f---- then it will print the verbose errors?
[2024-01-23 03:40] <morgan-u2> ... wait wait. (i inserted a flash drive that made a noise when I inserted it and showe dup in files.) so then I removed my passport drive and inserted it in THAT usb slot.  It worked this time. --- SMH (scratching my head)
[2024-01-23 03:42] <morgan-u2> no more problems. I am ready to do things. thank you. - - telepathy of competence works (my acting belief system).

[2024-01-23 08:37] <kotgc> I should add the monitors did work until 2 weeks ago when I changed a storage disk SSD.
[2024-01-23 08:39] <kotgc> So, nomodeset after quiet splash or to replace quiet splash?
[2024-01-23 08:48] <kotgc> test
[2024-01-23 08:48] <kotgc> ok, tried nomodeset and now there's more black screens? https://dpaste.com/C9HCW3AU6

[2024-01-23 14:48] <SteelRose> Hello! Is there anyone here using Ubuntu Pro + realtime kernel on EKS? Thanks
[2024-01-23 14:49] <lotuspsychje> best to ask your real question SteelRose so volunteers can point you in the right direction
[2024-01-23 14:51] <SteelRose> lotuspsychje: that's my real question
[2024-01-23 14:51] <SteelRose> I can rephrase it: I need to run a realtime kernel on EKS. Is it possible?
[2024-01-23 14:52] <leftyfb> SteelRose: that would be an Amazon support question
[2024-01-23 14:52] <SteelRose> 1103 users in this channel and nobody runs such a thing, so I need to ask AWS?
[2024-01-23 14:53] <SteelRose> fair enough
[2024-01-23 15:28] <Guest23> Ok to discuss ubuntuDDE here ?

[2024-01-23 23:31] <ubuntu> Hello
[2024-01-23 23:31] <Jack> Hi
[2024-01-23 23:52] <wixboo> Hi there
[2024-01-23 23:52] <wixboo> Looking for a command equivalent to: powercfg /batteryreport /output stuff.html
[2024-01-23 23:52] <wixboo> ?
[2024-01-23 23:53] <rbox> what does that do
[2024-01-23 23:53] <oerheks> dmidecode -t 22
[2024-01-23 23:54] <oerheks> upower -i `upower -e | grep 'BAT'`
[2024-01-23 23:54] <oerheks> 2nd one i used in a conky
[2024-01-23 23:55] <wixboo> Is there a way to check its history and statistics?
[2024-01-23 23:55] <wixboo> powercfg batteryreport gives you historic usage of the battery.. Like each day how many hours the laptop was on and such.
[2024-01-23 23:57] <oerheks> not from your battery, that requires some service to log that
[2024-01-23 23:57] <wixboo> The upower command output does say battery has historye YES, has stastistics YES..
[2024-01-23 23:57] <wixboo> But then how come windows can do it? I think the data from powercfg comes from the BIOS
[2024-01-23 23:58] <wixboo> Or some other way to know when was the laptop used during the last months.. ?
[2024-01-24 00:00] <sarnold> maybe journalctl --list-boots  ?
[2024-01-24 00:02] <wixboo> Thats cool, in the line of what im looking for.. sarnold
[2024-01-24 00:02] <wixboo> Lookking for something that could survive OS reinstalls
[2024-01-24 00:02] <wixboo> Or identify live USB boots..
[2024-01-24 00:03] <oerheks> journalctl will be overwritten
[2024-01-24 00:17] <wixboo> So far it seems powercfg /batteryreport comes from the battery itself not the OS..
[2024-01-24 00:17] <wixboo> There must be someting similar in Ubuntu
[2024-01-24 00:20] <oerheks> status yes, history not.
[2024-01-24 01:49] <SuperLag> Any of you folks use Cockpit for managing your Ubuntu machine(s)?
[2024-01-24 03:17] <Patrick_> has anyone experienced that the ubuntu firefox snap no longer makes a sound when you press Ctrl+Q to quit and it opens the confirmation dialog?
[2024-01-24 03:17] <Patrick_> this just started recently
[2024-01-24 03:25] <lotuspsychje> Patrick_: firefox snap issues/bugs goto mozilla upstream now
[2024-01-24 03:26] <lotuspsychje> Patrick_: check snap info firefox for the link
[2024-01-24 03:26] <Patrick_> good to know, but I'm still wondering if anyone else is experiencing it. Sound is otherwise normal and I know that that sound is still there in firefox nightly
[2024-01-24 03:28] <lotuspsychje> Patrick_: i just tested, and getting a sound + window confirm prompt (tested on 24.04 devel)
[2024-01-24 03:28] <lotuspsychje> Patrick_: maybe you can go test on a new user, to see its user related?
[2024-01-24 03:28] <Patrick_> Interesting. Thanks for the feedback. I even made a new profile and it had no sound for the quit dialog either.
[2024-01-24 03:29] <Patrick_> hmm, I suppose I could try a new user, though I have no idea how that would be effecting it.
[2024-01-24 03:29] <lotuspsychje> its just for testing
[2024-01-24 05:02] <Elliria> Hey there. Does Kubuntu 22.04 LTS have a different kernel than Ubuntu 22.04 LTS?
[2024-01-24 05:04] <Bashing-om> Elliria: No - but HWE can come into play.
[2024-01-24 05:04] <Bashing-om> !hwe | Elliria
[2024-01-24 05:04] <ubottu> Elliria: The Ubuntu LTS enablement stacks provide newer kernel and X support for existing LTS releases, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack
[2024-01-24 05:06] <Elliria> Interesting. I've got two 5-series kernels on my Kubuntu 22.04 LTS machine and someone in one of the mailing lists just installed Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and it came with a 5-series and a 6-series kernel.
[2024-01-24 05:07] <Elliria> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2024-January/311857.html
[2024-01-24 05:08] <younder> Strange 22.04 still uses 5 versions
[2024-01-24 05:09] <Elliria> I asked about it. Maybe he'll let us know.
[2024-01-24 05:10] <younder> ubuntu 23.10 uses 6.5 now
[2024-01-24 05:10] <Bashing-om> Elliria: 22.04 and 22,04.1 has the GA kernel - 5.15.0-91-generic where a 22.04.3 install will have 23.10's kernel (HWE).
[2024-01-24 05:11] <Elliria> Is 23.10 using the 6.5.0-14-generic kernel?

[2024-01-24 08:33] <hid3> Greetings everyone. Some my scripts launch a command 'screen -AdmS <name> <command>'. However, the problem is that sometimes <command> exits with exit code other than 0. Question: is it possible to make screen not terminate instantly if exit code is other than 0? So that I could resume the sccreen and actually see the output what went wrong
[2024-01-24 08:34] <TomyWork> I'm on 22.04 now and I'm using chromium and firefox, both snaps. I'm running Microsoft Teams as a PWA in chromium and on my old machine (18.04) I had everything set up, so links from teams would be opened in firefox. that no longer works, even after I adjusted the firefox path in the settings of the plugin I'm using from /usr/bin/firefox to /snap/bin/firefox. Is there an issue calling invoking one snap from another?
[2024-01-24 08:37] <TomyWork> ok yes, there is an issue: I'm getting "Permission denied" when trying to run "/snap/bin/firefox --help" from "snap run --shell chromium"
[2024-01-24 08:54] <TomyWork> how do I allow the chromium snap to invoke a specific program (firefox)? (yes, I am aware that this will probably allow arbitrary code execution outside the snap confinement)

[2024-01-24 11:11] <SteelRose> hello
[2024-01-24 11:11] <SteelRose> anyone here works at Canonical?
[2024-01-24 11:12] <SteelRose> their "Contact us"-methods are somewhat a lie: the form says "we'll get back to you in 1 working day". Still waiting... and when you call them, nobody picks it up....
[2024-01-24 11:13] <hclaim> why do you need to speak to them so bad?
[2024-01-24 11:21] <SteelRose> hclaim: their pricing page on the Pro plan doesn't mention anything about EKS
[2024-01-24 11:22] <SteelRose> they don mention OpenStack, etc... almost 4K a pop...
[2024-01-24 11:22] <SteelRose> but EKS is what I'm interested in
[2024-01-24 11:22] <hclaim> oh okay, well good luck, they will probably respond eventually
[2024-01-24 11:23] <SteelRose> I hope so... :-) A full project depends on that
[2024-01-24 11:24] <TomyWork> I had an inspiration about my problem from earlier: instead of invoking firefox directly, I just rely on the fact that firefox is my default browser and invoke /usr/bin/xdg-open instead of /snap/bin/firefox :)
[2024-01-24 11:25] <TomyWork> that seems to be allowed from within a snap container
[2024-01-24 11:59] <sshTrouble> Hi! Since a recent update, my SSH client cannot connect to any remote host, only to local network ones. It just timeouts. This is specific to SSH, as NMAP or other programs can connect perfectly to the same destinations. Even SSH from inside a Docker can connect. I've checked with Wireshark and the SYN packet from SSH is never acknowledged, but
[2024-01-24 11:59] <sshTrouble> looks exactly the same as the one from NMAP, which does work. It's the most odd thing I've ever seen... Any hints to what could be the cause?
[2024-01-24 12:01] <ravage> sounds like a firewall
[2024-01-24 12:02] <sshTrouble> Doesn't seem to be that. I have all traffic allowed, and nmap connects correctly from the same computer. Only SSH is affected...
[2024-01-24 12:49] <lotuspsychje> sshTrouble: does nmap see your ssh server running?
[2024-01-24 12:50] <sshTrouble> Yes. I've been trying and if I use a different SSH binary, it connects perfectly too. Only the distribution provided one is failing for me.
[2024-01-24 12:51] <lotuspsychje> sshTrouble: open port or filtered?
[2024-01-24 12:51] <sshTrouble> Open
[2024-01-24 12:52] <lotuspsychje> did you try a reboot of the ssh server, system up to date?
[2024-01-24 12:52] <lotuspsychje> wich ubuntu release , ssh version is this?
[2024-01-24 12:53] <sshTrouble> This is Ubuntu 23.10, and SSH OpenSSH_9.3p1 Ubuntu-1ubuntu3.2
[2024-01-24 12:54] <lotuspsychje> looks the right version indeed
[2024-01-24 12:54] <sshTrouble> I tried downgrading to the previous patch (without the .2) and the same happens. But using older releases works...
[2024-01-24 12:55] <lotuspsychje> did you recently mess with anything special?
[2024-01-24 12:56] <sshTrouble> Not really... I did update recently from 23.04, that's clearly related, but that's all.
[2024-01-24 12:57] <lotuspsychje> did you do it before 23.04 went end of life?
[2024-01-24 12:57] <sshTrouble> Yes - barely
[2024-01-24 12:58] <imi> hi, can the progress line at the bottom be removed from the output of apt upgrade?
[2024-01-24 12:59] <sshTrouble> I've just tried something new and I think the results are interesting. I've downloaded the OpenSSH sources for 9.6 (the latest release), built them, and they have exactly the same problem. There must be something on my system making newer openssh versions fail to connect, not only the ubuntu provided one.
[2024-01-24 13:00] <lotuspsychje> sshTrouble: are you using something to protect ssh hammering, that could do some blocking?
[2024-01-24 13:01] <sshTrouble> No... In fact this happens with any servers, and with anything using SSH under the hood like git with ssh remotes. It doesn't seem to be related to the servers, only to the client.
[2024-01-24 13:02] <lotuspsychje> maybe go check your auth logs sshTrouble you never know its compromised?
[2024-01-24 13:03] <sshTrouble> Not likely. Again, I can't even push to github, and it works perfectly as soon as I use an older SSH version, from the same terminal...
[2024-01-24 13:04] <lotuspsychje> ok, just trying to think along
[2024-01-24 13:07] <sshTrouble> For now I think I'll just downgrade SSH to an older release as that's proven to fix it, so I can continue working, but I'll keep investigating it. I suspect it can be related to some linked library which is not compatible with more modern SSH versions...
[2024-01-24 13:29] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-24 13:37] <plujon> On Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, what kind of "suspend" does "Suspend" do?  Suspend to ram or suspend to disk?
[2024-01-24 13:40] <imi> idk but my best guess is "suspend to disk" would be called "hybernating". I was never a big fan of either
[2024-01-24 14:13] <deadmund> Running Ubuntu 20.04.6 (recently updated) and in my repositories there is no package called "phoronix-test-suite" despite there being strong indication of it existing: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PhoronixTestSuite   Does this package exist or not?

[2024-01-24 14:15] <ogra_> wikipage last edited in 2011 ...
[2024-01-24 14:16] <deadmund> I guess that wiki page needs a serious update!
[2024-01-24 14:16] <ogra_> only 13y old ð
[2024-01-24 14:16] <deadmund> I wonder why the package was removed?  The software itself still seems well maintained otherwise.
[2024-01-24 14:16] <leftyfb> deadmund: it looks like the package was last available in ubuntu 18.04 but has since been removed
[2024-01-24 14:16] <ogra_> nobody maintained it i guess
[2024-01-24 14:16] <deadmund> https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite/
[2024-01-24 14:17] <deadmund> They literally distribute a .deb on their downloads page.
[2024-01-24 14:17] <leftyfb> then use that
[2024-01-24 14:17] <deadmund> Ubuntu ð
[2024-01-24 14:17] <deadmund> Yeah, I guess I will have to since Ubuntu makes it so difficult to get into and stay in the official repos.
[2024-01-24 14:18] <ogra_> well, if nobody steps up to do the maintenance work you can't do a lot
[2024-01-24 14:19] <deadmund> Thanks for the help!
[2024-01-24 14:19] <leftyfb> deadmund: it was part of the universe repository, which means it was maintained by the community. If you're interested in maintaining the package, you are welcome to take up that responsibility
[2024-01-24 14:19] <leftyfb> deadmund: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard
[2024-01-24 14:21] <deadmund> I'll look into it.  Thank you! :)
[2024-01-24 14:21] <leftyfb> deadmund: and yes, I'm very greatful Ubuntu isn't just pulling in random packages/deb's without someone focused on maintaining said package and the package and it's code going through proper testing
[2024-01-24 14:23] <webchat18> Hi, is this the place for Bluetooth issues?
[2024-01-24 14:24] <ogra_> this is the place for ubuntu issues ð
[2024-01-24 14:24] <webchat18> thanks :)
[2024-01-24 14:31] <webchat18> I have an unexplained problem,
[2024-01-24 14:32] <webchat18> I have a Logitech keyboard and mouse (MX keys & MX master 3s)
[2024-01-24 14:32] <webchat18> I moved from an old computer (HP Laptop 15-dw3xxx with ubuntu 22.04) where the pairing of the keyboard and mouse works without a problem,
[2024-01-24 14:32] <webchat18> For a new computer (Victus Gaming Laptop 16-r0008nj (800K3EA))
[2024-01-24 14:32] <webchat18> First I installed the same operating system on it (ubuntu 22.04) but I couldn't find the devices in the Bluetooth list, so I upgraded to Ubuntu 23.10
[2024-01-24 14:32] <webchat18> I can't pair the keyboard and the mouse no matter what I do!
[2024-01-24 14:33] <deadmund> webchat18: Can you give us more information about what you tried to do and how the process is failing?
[2024-01-24 14:33] <deadmund> What does the process of pairing look like?
[2024-01-24 14:34] <webchat18> Of course I'm in Bluetooth discovery mode on the keyboard and mouse.
[2024-01-24 14:34] <webchat18> On the old computer I see the keyboard and the past in the list but not on the new one
[2024-01-24 14:34] <webchat18> I installed solaar but nothing works

[2024-01-24 14:51] <Haris_> hello all
[2024-01-24 14:51] <Haris_> how do I extend / partition on focal? (20 LTS)
[2024-01-24 14:52] <deadmund> To extend a partition it cannot be mounted.  That makes it much more complex to extend partitions like / (root) since you can't unmount them while your OS is running.
[2024-01-24 14:52] <deadmund> But, generally, you use a partition program like gparted and it's a GUI so pretty easy to use.
[2024-01-24 14:53] <Haris_> https://serverfault.com/questions/38542/ubuntu-resize-the-root-lvm2-partition
[2024-01-24 14:53] <imi> the easiest way would be to use gparted. make sure you back everything up. also, you can use a most modern gparted by downloading a newer live cd
[2024-01-24 14:53] <Haris_> I'm on cli only
[2024-01-24 14:53] <deadmund> Haris_: Are you working on a virtual machine as well?
[2024-01-24 14:53] <jeremy31> Haris_: boot the Ubuntu iso on usb
[2024-01-24 14:54] <Haris_> yes. its a vm
[2024-01-24 14:54] <ogra_> the included disks tool should do as well ... so you shouldnt need to install gparted on the live iso ...
[2024-01-24 14:54] <ogra_> ah, VM is different indeed
[2024-01-24 14:54] <deadmund> Shut down the VM and use gparted on the host to adjust the size of the partitions on the virtual hard-drive (can that be done with gparted?  opening a virtula harddrive file?)
[2024-01-24 14:55] <ogra_> what kind of VM is that ?
[2024-01-24 14:55] <Haris_> vmware
[2024-01-24 14:55] <ogra_> https://askubuntu.com/questions/220506/how-to-increase-the-disk-space-of-an-ubuntu-vmware-guest-without-the-cd
[2024-01-24 14:56] <ogra_> theer is quite a bunch of hits on google ...
[2024-01-24 14:59] <Haris_> can booting from ubuntu-22.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso or ubuntu-23.10-server help with getting gparted running?
[2024-01-24 15:00] <ogra_> no, but you could then use parted (the cli version) ... but thats significantly harder to use, mind you
[2024-01-24 15:01] <Haris_> I wouldn'v thought OS platforms would endevour to make it easier to extend volumes. not difficult
[2024-01-24 15:02] <ogra_> why can't you use a desktop iso ? no gui at all on the host ?
[2024-01-24 15:05] <Haris_> this is a vmware vm. I normally don't use gui
[2024-01-24 15:05] <Haris_> its a server. not purposed to be used as a desktop
[2024-01-24 15:06] <patrikvk> Hello! Anyone free to help me a little bit? =) have a problem that I didnt use to have. Im running Ubuntu 22 and I have Gnome Tweaks installed, and I downloaded a shell theme called Sweet Ambar Blue, but whatever shell theme I choose it doesnt change anything. Everything looks the same. Does anyone have any idea what to do? Ive googled the issue but i cant seem to find anything that helps
[2024-01-24 15:06] <lotuspsychje> !themes | patrikvk
[2024-01-24 15:06] <ubottu> patrikvk: Find your themes at: http://www.gnome-look.org - http://art.gnome.org - http://www.kde-look.org - http://kubuntu-art.org - http://freecode.com/tags/theme - http://www.guistyles.com - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/ - Also see !changethemes and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy
[2024-01-24 15:08] <patrikvk> Thank you, but I have a theme. But whatever theme I try to apply, its not applying. Everything stays the same (except for icons) but when I try to change the shell theme, all the colors are the same
[2024-01-24 15:09] <ogra_> Haris_, right, so if you run vmware on a server host you'll indeed not be able to have vmware spawn a gui ...
[2024-01-24 15:10] <Haris_> I'm on a cloud from a provider which is based on vmware
[2024-01-24 15:10] <ogra_> so you'll need to use onr of the other methods that google provides when searching, it isnt like there are not 1000s of hits for that
[2024-01-24 15:11] <Haris_> one attempt didn't go well. trying again
[2024-01-24 15:12] <ogra_> apparently there is the vmkfstools tool you can use for this
[2024-01-24 15:13] <ogra_> and there is even upstream documentation .... https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1002019
[2024-01-24 15:19] <lotuspsychje> patrikvk: maybe this can help too; https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/05/install-themes-ubuntu-22-04/
[2024-01-24 15:23] <patrikvk> Thank you Lotus, I have done all that too, but its still not working :( I think it might be down to that I had to go to a website and download some sort of a chrome extension (i dont know why) and it asked me which version of this and that I needed and I just chose the latest version for both
[2024-01-24 15:23] <tupni> if you get themes from an as official source as possible, ie the creators, or something, they usually bring instructions, afaik
[2024-01-24 15:24] <patrikvk> True, but i cant even change to the included themes like Yaru
[2024-01-24 15:24] <tupni> try find out who made the theme, and see if they've got some homepage or official repository, perhaps
[2024-01-24 15:24] <tupni> ok
[2024-01-24 15:27] <zniavre> patrikvk, you need to activate the " user theme " extension with gnome-shell to change GS theme
[2024-01-24 15:27] <patrikvk> I think ive done that, I ran a command in terminal i believe
[2024-01-24 15:27] <patrikvk> I could be wrong
[2024-01-24 15:29] <patrikvk> with previous version of ubuntu i didnt have this problem, im not sure what ive done to make it difficult
[2024-01-24 15:34] <tupni> there should be some plaintext file you could edit to revert to Yaru
[2024-01-24 15:34] <tupni> the old themes should still be there
[2024-01-24 15:35] <patrikvk> I do have the old themes (default, yaru and my new theme Sweet blue somthing)... but it all looks like "default" no matter if I choose yaru red, yaru blue, yaru dark or "Sweet blue" :(
[2024-01-24 15:36] <patrikvk> Sweet Ambar Blue was supposed to look like this https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1897311 but instead it looks like standard default Ubuntu
[2024-01-24 15:37] <tupni> are you running gnome or kde?
[2024-01-24 15:37] <tupni> that's a kde theme it appears
[2024-01-24 15:37] <patrikvk> gnome
[2024-01-24 15:37] <patrikvk> oh
[2024-01-24 15:40] <patrikvk> i downloaded another theme, im going to see if it works
[2024-01-24 15:40] <patrikvk> Great! "Purple and peach GT OE2" works! It changed the top bar to purple! But my main windows still have the grey colouor
[2024-01-24 15:41] <patrikvk> Now I have another option called "Applications" that i didnt have before, so its a step forward!
[2024-01-24 15:42] <tupni> there used to be a key combination one could press to re'boot' the wm session without logging out but I forgot what it was
[2024-01-24 15:42] <tupni> maybe that could help freshen things up, or logging out, if practical, as well
[2024-01-24 15:43] <arraybolt3> pretty sure that no longer works on Wayland
[2024-01-24 15:43] <patrikvk> Will try that, thank you!
[2024-01-24 15:43] <arraybolt3> I also don't remember the key combo but it only works with GNOME+X11.
[2024-01-24 15:43] <arraybolt3> it will outright refuse to let you do it on Wayland and tell you why.
[2024-01-24 15:43] <tupni> oh I see, thanks for clarifying
[2024-01-24 15:45] <ioria> alt+f2 + r; enter
[2024-01-24 15:45] <Haris_> if I have no nmcli how do I configure lan interface ip settings on cli?
[2024-01-24 15:45] <Haris_> on vmware console for a ubuntu focal vm
[2024-01-24 15:45] <ioria> ip or ifconfig
[2024-01-24 15:46] <Haris_> how to do that with ip
[2024-01-24 15:47] <leftyfb> Haris_: if you want to configure your network and save the settings, you modify your file in /etc/netplan/
[2024-01-24 15:47] <leftyfb> !netplan | Haris_
[2024-01-24 15:47] <ubottu> Haris_: Netplan is a network configuration abstraction renderer which uses YAML descriptions of a network to work with either a NetworkManager or Systemd-networkd "renderer". More information at https://netplan.io/
[2024-01-24 15:47] <leftyfb> Haris_: what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[2024-01-24 15:47] <ioria> Haris_, if you have netplan use that
[2024-01-24 15:47] <Haris_> first time based setup of a vm for remote access and subsequent setup
[2024-01-24 15:47] <Haris_> based=base
[2024-01-24 15:48] <Haris_> i installed this one from a 20.06 live cd iso image
[2024-01-24 15:48] <Haris_> looks like I got a minimal install
[2024-01-24 15:48] <leftyfb> Haris_: if you installed Ubuntu 22.04 server on top of VMware, it should have defaulted to DHCP and the network should have worked out of the box
[2024-01-24 15:48] <leftyfb> Haris_: there is no such thing as Ubuntu 20.06
[2024-01-24 15:49] <leftyfb> Haris_: if you're installing new, I highly suggest you install Ubuntu 22.04 server
[2024-01-24 15:50] <Haris_> ubuntu-20.04.6--live-server-amd64
[2024-01-24 15:50] <Haris_> its the name of an iso in the provider's library for OS install for a vm
[2024-01-24 15:50] <Haris_> guest vm
[2024-01-24 15:50] <leftyfb> Haris_: look for 22.04
[2024-01-24 15:51] <Haris_> dhcp != required
[2024-01-24 15:51] <Haris_> statically set IP is required
[2024-01-24 15:51] <ioria> Haris_, https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-static-ip-address-on-ubuntu-20-04/
[2024-01-24 15:51] <Haris_> its a tiny setup
[2024-01-24 15:51] <leftyfb> ok, then configure your netplan file in /etc/netplan/

[2024-01-24 16:02] <Haris_> I used spaces in place of tabs for indentation

[2024-01-24 16:03] <tupni> installing from floppy disk?
[2024-01-24 16:04] <Haris_> I mean non-relevant output to what I'm doing
[2024-01-24 16:04] <ioria> that's a weird output from netplan
[2024-01-24 16:04] <leftyfb> that looks like your VM has a floppy drive configured but isn't relevant to the network issue
[2024-01-24 16:04] <leftyfb> ioria: I'm guessing it's just kernel output

[2024-01-24 16:10] <leftyfb> it says the interface is down
[2024-01-24 16:10] <leftyfb> Haris_: I don't think you have the virtual interface in VMware enabled or on a proper vlan or something

[2024-01-24 16:17] <leftyfb> no, it's still supported for another 13 months
[2024-01-24 16:18] <Haris_> I have a bad mirror for archive. Is there one that is usable
[2024-01-24 16:18] <leftyfb> but if you're doing a new install, I don't know why you wouldn't choose the latest LTS
[2024-01-24 16:18] <leftyfb> us.archive.ubuntu.com
[2024-01-24 16:18] <Haris_> always keep a production box one step behind the current ver

[2024-01-24 16:18] <leftyfb> I get what you're saying, but that isn't really applicable here

[2024-01-24 16:19] <Haris_> does Jenkins work on the latest ubuntu ver?
[2024-01-24 16:19] <Haris_> Let me check with jenkins people
[2024-01-24 16:19] <leftyfb> Ubuntu 22.04 is the latest Long Term Support release of Ubuntu. This is considered the latest stable release. There have been 3 releases since
[2024-01-24 16:20] <leftyfb> There have been 7 releases of Ubuntu since 20.04 was released
[2024-01-24 16:23] <Haris_> checking internally with my guys
[2024-01-24 16:25] <Haris_> ok good. they'r happy with the latest lts

[2024-01-25 03:22] <Sam134943> like a driver issue?
[2024-01-25 03:24] <rbox> you might need to install the nvidia driver
[2024-01-25 03:37] <P1ro> Hi, in Ubuntu 22.04.3 im trying to set max open files, so far i have add it to: /etc/security/limits.conf, add session required to /etc/pam.d/common-session also fs.file-max = 2097152 to /etc/sysctl.conf, DefaultLimitNOFILE=65536 to /etc/systemd/system.conf and /etc/systemd/user.conf , but atfer restart ulimit -a shows default 1024, what else i can check ?

[2024-01-25 04:41] <rbox> whats to renew
[2024-01-25 04:43] <jmw> I flushed the old address with "ip -6 addr flush eth0" and want to get new autoconf addresses
[2024-01-25 04:43] <rbox> you could link down adn link up
[2024-01-25 04:44] <jmw> if I kill the link I'll lose the ssh connection to the host...
[2024-01-25 04:46] <rbox> i dont think yo ucan force the router to do anythig

[2024-01-25 12:46] <Haris_> do I need to adapt apparmor config for allowing npm to acces /tmp?
[2024-01-25 12:47] <Haris_> much like selinux on centos
[2024-01-25 12:48] <tupni> can't you just define a custom temp folder you've got rw access to, for it?
[2024-01-25 12:48] <Haris_> I'm not sure which npm uses or where to configure it
[2024-01-25 12:48] <Haris_> ..which folder+ npm uses..
[2024-01-25 12:51] <tupni> Haris_: you're supposed to be able to specify a tmp folder : https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/folders/
[2024-01-25 12:51] <tupni> Haris_: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/config/#tmp
[2024-01-25 12:52] <Haris_> when running npm as root, the only reason I can think of why it wouldn't be able to access /tmp .. is .. apparmor or selinux
[2024-01-25 12:53] <tupni> or it notices it's executed by root and auto-constrains itself perhaps
[2024-01-25 13:56] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-25 13:57] <leftyfb> Haris_: it sounds like you're just assuming apparmor is the cause of your issue?
[2024-01-25 14:01] <tuxinator> Hi
[2024-01-25 14:02] <tuxinator> So what is the "proper" standard way of adding search domains in to ubuntu 22.04 ? nmcli? netplan? resolveconf? There seems to be no clear docs on that
[2024-01-25 14:02] <leftyfb> tuxinator: server or desktop?
[2024-01-25 14:03] <tuxinator> leftyfb: Desktop
[2024-01-25 14:04] <leftyfb> tuxinator: nm-connection-manager would be my go-to
[2024-01-25 14:04] <leftyfb> tuxinator: actually, I would do this on my DHCP server (router)
[2024-01-25 14:04] <tuxinator> on the cli
[2024-01-25 14:04] <leftyfb> why?
[2024-01-25 14:05] <tuxinator> i want to deploy it
[2024-01-25 14:05] <tuxinator> multiple search domains seem to be unsupported by our dhcp

[2024-01-25 14:06] <tuxinator> leftyfb: thats for redhat 7 and Ubuntu seems to use netplan isn't it
[2024-01-25 14:07] <leftyfb> tuxinator: Ubuntu desktop uses Network Manager to manage network setting/profiles. It doesn't matter the distro, nmcli is the same
[2024-01-25 14:11] <tuxinator> leftyfb: not fully true
[2024-01-25 14:11] <tuxinator> https://ubuntu.com/blog/netplan-configuration-across-desktop-server-cloud-and-iot#:~:text=Netplan%20is%20the%20default%20tool,hand%20over%20control%20to%20NetworkManager.
[2024-01-25 14:12] <tuxinator> beginning with 23.10 it changes
[2024-01-25 14:13] <leftyfb> tuxinator: first, that's for 23.10 which you aren't running. 2nd, that only entails the files where the configurations get saved to. Network Manager and nmcli are still used to configure your network profiles from the GUI and command line.
[2024-01-25 14:14] <leftyfb> yes, netplan is the backend. But NM is still the front-end
[2024-01-25 14:47] <wwacko> if i give yall nerds a ip address can yu hack it?
[2024-01-25 14:48] <tupni> wwacko: we don't do that stuff in here.
[2024-01-25 14:49] <tupni> you gave us yours when you joined the channel, by the way.
[2024-01-25 14:50] <wwacko> is that a threat
[2024-01-25 14:50] <tupni> of course not
[2024-01-25 14:51] <tupni> this channel is for Ubuntu support, wwacko.
[2024-01-25 14:53] <leftyfb> wwacko: take it elsewhere
[2024-01-25 16:42] <Mrpanda> hi everyone. my firefox was zapped and now wont start, tries then stops. is ther any way I can fix this ?
[2024-01-25 16:46] <leftyfb> mrpond: what release of ubuntu? Define "zapped". How do you have Firefox installed?
[2024-01-25 16:46] <leftyfb> :/    or not
[2024-01-25 16:57] <tupni> sad ponda, leftyfb
[2024-01-25 16:57] <tupni> some just want to do a burnout before they exit abruptly, sometimes
[2024-01-25 16:58] <tupni> you tried to help
[2024-01-25 17:38] <denisbr> Hi, Can I define init level for leve 3 ? without graphic ?
[2024-01-25 17:39] <leftyfb> denisbr: without mentioning "init levels", what is exactly you're trying to accomplish?
[2024-01-25 17:41] <rfm> denisbr, ubuntu doesn't really use init levels since it's systemd.  If you want to boot into console (non graphic) use "systemctl set-default multi-user.target"
[2024-01-25 17:44] <denisbr> I need to boot on machine without graphic for some tests and sandbox play :-)
[2024-01-25 17:45] <leftyfb> denisbr: ok, then follow rfm's instructions
[2024-01-25 17:45] <denisbr> leftyfb: ok ... rfm thanks a lot
[2024-01-25 19:03] <Toasty> I'm trying to get my head round how snaps impact my backups. The ~/snap folder seems to mix configuration data, program data and user data and some of the data seems to be duplicated repeatedly in numbered folders. Is there a good guide on what I need to back up that someone could please point me to?
[2024-01-25 19:04] <leftyfb> Toasty: it's likely not duplicated but linked with symlinks across the different releases of the app
[2024-01-25 19:05] <Toasty> leftyfb: I worry that if I do my backup incorrectly that I will end up backing up the duplicates.
[2024-01-25 19:05] <leftyfb> Toasty: typically the confs are saved in ~/snap/<app name>/common
[2024-01-25 19:05] <leftyfb> but I've seen sometimes where it's saved in ~/snap/<app name>/current/path/to/conf
[2024-01-25 19:05] <Toasty> That's going to make for some intresting multilevel wildcards.
[2024-01-25 19:06] <Toasty> Yuck! Why couldn't it separate program files and config?
[2024-01-25 19:06] <Toasty> (To a different top level tree)
[2024-01-25 19:06] <leftyfb> Toasty: I would look through the individual snaps and see if there's any you cae about that aren't saved in common. If not, then you only need to worry about backing up the common directories
[2024-01-25 19:07] <Toasty> That would work, but it doesn't scale for any future snaps I install.
[2024-01-25 19:08] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: Snaps run differently from other applications. By default, they're only given access to their folders inside the ~/snap folder. A user has to grant permission for a snap deployed application to see the rest of the file system.
[2024-01-25 19:08] <Toasty> The user data seems to be duplicated. I guess I should only back up the stuff under current, but that's going to be a nasty rule to write.
[2024-01-25 19:08] <leftyfb> stick with common unless you notice config data being written to current
[2024-01-25 19:08] <Toasty> pragmaticenigma: I can understand that, but I can't see why everything is mixed up in such a messy way.
[2024-01-25 19:08] <leftyfb> and if the latter, maybe file a bug
[2024-01-25 19:09] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: "current" points to one of the revision folders. It's a sym link
[2024-01-25 19:09] <Toasty> The revision folders are not symlinks though and hold duplicate data.
[2024-01-25 19:09] <pragmaticenigma> that's so you can roll back an update
[2024-01-25 19:10] <Toasty> There's user data there too though. I would normally want to roll back the app, not the work I've done in it.
[2024-01-25 19:10] <pragmaticenigma> If you start with revision 1, then revision 2 comes along and breaks something. You only have to change the symlink current to point to revision 1
[2024-01-25 19:10] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: If there is user data in those folders, you should file a bug with the developer or maintainer of that snap. Snaps are supposed to only store user data in the common folder
[2024-01-25 19:10] <Toasty> I'm looking at OBS.
[2024-01-25 19:11] <leftyfb> Slack is one of the offenders
[2024-01-25 19:12] <Toasty> Thing is, if it's not reliable, I'll have to re-do my backup scripts for every new app.
[2024-01-25 19:13] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: are you sure the data you're finding is user data? and not just auto config stuff that OBS generates on each load?
[2024-01-25 19:13] <Toasty> These are large .mkv files.
[2024-01-25 19:13] <Toasty> I'm sure snap could have separated out program data, config and user data at the top level with sub folders holding the versions as now. That would have enforced separation. I wonder why it wasn't done that way?
[2024-01-25 19:15] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: If it was me, I would only back up what's in `common` and `current` (being that current points to the currently active revision.)
[2024-01-25 19:17] <Toasty> Thanks.
[2024-01-25 19:18] <Toasty> I'm now wondering how many of my files are squirrelled away in odd directories.
[2024-01-25 19:19] <Toasty> That and if it's really duplicating file, or if they are some sort of link that's not immediately obvious in a directory listing.
[2024-01-25 19:19] <cleric> Is there something wrong with linux-hwe-6.5-headers-6.5.0-15? It's not listed on packages.ubuntu.com but I pulled that down earlier and dpkg failed to unpack it (just hung forever) causing quite an annoyance as I rolled back to -14. Just curious if anyone else has seen that
[2024-01-25 19:19] <pragmaticenigma> most of what I suspect you are seeing is cache files from active sessions that aren't nicely being cleaned up
[2024-01-25 19:20] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: most of what I suspect you are seeing is cache files from active sessions that aren't nicely being cleaned up
[2024-01-25 19:20] <leftyfb> not with Slack
[2024-01-25 19:20] <Toasty> I'm not running OBS now and haven't for months.
[2024-01-25 19:21] <pragmaticenigma> doesn't mean the program is a good stewards and cleans up everything on exit
[2024-01-25 19:22] <leftyfb> pragmaticenigma: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/Gfd6W24DXx/
[2024-01-25 19:22] <leftyfb> the ~/snap/slack/common/.config is just cache. The actual configs are in common
[2024-01-25 19:23] <Toasty> apt enforced separation of program data and everything else. Snap should also.
[2024-01-25 19:24] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: I'm not aware of apt having that feature... apt just installs and removes packages. The "proper" placement of things is completely up to the developer. Gaining admitance to a well known package repository might be the enforcement you're thinking of
[2024-01-25 19:25] <Toasty> Apt installs the program files outside the user directory.
[2024-01-25 19:26] <Toasty> I've found a game that's copying the game assets every time it's updates. Luckly they are only 350MB, but that's just daft.
[2024-01-25 19:26] <Toasty> s/it's/it
[2024-01-25 19:26] <pragmaticenigma> apt manages nothing. the packager decides where things goes
[2024-01-25 19:27] <Toasty> Perhaps I've got the terminology wrong, but I don't see any packages that I've installed though apt or similar having the install files mixed up with the user data or config files.
[2024-01-25 19:28] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: MythTV would be one that does
[2024-01-25 19:28] <Toasty> Except when they were installed as snaps.
[2024-01-25 19:29] <Toasty> I've got a MythTV install somewhere. What stuff does it mix?
[2024-01-25 19:31] <pragmaticenigma> It's really not important at the moment. The point is apt has nothing to do with where things are put. The developer/maintainer of the package makes those decisions. If it is Canonical supplied, their devs take the time to make sure the applications files are in the right place and the application works
[2024-01-25 19:32] <Toasty> So you're saying that when I use ubuntu packages that are not snaps, everything o23
[2024-01-25 19:32] <Toasty> works?
[2024-01-25 19:33] <pragmaticenigma> That'd be impressive and there wouldn't be a need for launchpad for tracking bugs
[2024-01-25 19:33] <arraybolt3> It's *intended to* work, how about that? :)
[2024-01-25 19:33] <Toasty> :)
[2024-01-25 19:35] <Toasty> Well, I didn't have this problem before. I'm just going though the being rather miffed at design decisions that don't make sense to me, because now I've got more work to do and if I get the details wrong I have a broken backup. I'll get over it.
[2024-01-25 19:35] <pragmaticenigma> Toasty: If I'm trying to imply anything... is the quiet part of my opinion on snaps. That I personally do not like them, nor the direction they are going.
[2024-01-25 19:39] <pragmaticenigma> Given a moment, Toasty ... I have a prime example of what I was talking about earlier with mythtv... but it's not myth... it's snaps. The fact that in a user's root folder is ~/snap when really, it should probably be located in ~/.local and/or ~/.config as appropriate for the need.
[2024-01-25 19:39] <Toasty> That would be very useful.
[2024-01-25 19:40] <Toasty> Perhaps with another non-hidden /snap/userdata/appname tree.
[2024-01-25 19:43] <Toasty> I think I should be able to make an RSYNC reg expression for the excludes list that ignores snap directories  at the appropriate level which are made only of numbers.
[2024-01-25 19:43] <Toasty> That way I should avoid lots of duplicates. I can then exclude any .cache directories.
[2024-01-25 19:45] <Toasty> I still can't see a clean way of getting the user data without also getting the program files.
[2024-01-25 19:45] <Toasty> Not without app specific code.
[2024-01-25 19:47] <pragmaticenigma> are those program file plugins?
[2024-01-25 19:47] <pragmaticenigma> I'm assuming you're saying that you're finding executable binary code or something
[2024-01-25 19:48] <leftyfb> Toasty: I have 19 snaps installed and the common dir of all of them together is under 2GB
[2024-01-25 19:49] <leftyfb> sorry, current
[2024-01-25 19:49] <leftyfb> my common is out of control due to my personal settings and files
[2024-01-25 19:50] <Toasty> Current does seem to mix user generated files and program data.
[2024-01-25 19:51] <Toasty> Not without app specific code.
[2024-01-25 19:51] <Toasty> Sorry, ignore that last post.
[2024-01-25 19:52] <Toasty> My snap area is only 2.3GB, so it's a manageable problem for now, but more and more apps are becoming snaps. It will become more of an issue with time.
[2024-01-25 19:53] <pragmaticenigma> I kind of feel that it's safe to make that be a future you problem instead of a today one
[2024-01-25 19:54] <pragmaticenigma> If these were in flatpak world, I'm not sure we'd have this conversation, as I'm not sure how deep you'd would go looking for it's userspace files
[2024-01-25 19:59] <pragmaticenigma> I should finish that thought... as I have a feeling things can be just as messy there too
[2024-01-25 20:19] <tokam> Hi, is someone active here? I am having an issue to update zoom.
[2024-01-25 20:19] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BYFTTnTTHz/
[2024-01-25 20:19] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/8Rnq6Gq3s6/
[2024-01-25 20:21] <tokam> I think in the paste I once crashed my system. Usually on Ubuntu systems some package (what is it's name?) manages the creation of symlinks of libs so that they are in /lib/ and in /usr/lib and for some reason I had a lot of non-symlink libs which required some manual fixing. I guess the error I am facing now might be a left over from this trouble?
[2024-01-25 20:21] <tokam> Can someone please show me the output of: ls -al /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-linux.so.2
[2024-01-25 20:21] <leftyfb> tokam: what release of ubuntu is this?
[2024-01-25 20:22] <tokam> Release:	22.04
[2024-01-25 20:22] <jsmooth> I have installed Docker, but I"m not sure how to run it. I'm trying to use Laravel Sail which is a front-end to Docker.
[2024-01-25 20:23] <leftyfb> tokam: remove the zoom package completely and install the snap package
[2024-01-25 20:23] <leftyfb> jsmooth: I would suggest asking in #docker or reading some docker tutorials
[2024-01-25 20:23] <tokam> Ok I will do it. Anyways, is there a command to show prevailing errors in apt and dpkg?
[2024-01-25 20:24] <leftyfb> tokam: prevailing errors?
[2024-01-25 20:24] <tokam> I mean version conflicts and errors that I have in my system
[2024-01-25 20:24] <leftyfb> tokam: you get those errors when trying to install or update packages
[2024-01-25 20:24] <tokam> for example I get an error displayed each for each apt operation regaring php8.1-cli
[2024-01-25 20:25] <leftyfb> tokam: you don't go about manually messing with links. Remove the offending package completely and if it's a 3rd party application, you reach out to the vendor for support with it
[2024-01-25 20:25] <tokam> I had some severe bug, in the past that left the system in state were a complete newinstall was justified and I had to manually fix things
[2024-01-25 20:26] <leftyfb> tokam: we only try to troubleshoot existing issues here. Not ones you had in the past
[2024-01-25 20:26] <leftyfb> tokam: remove zoom completely, see where your packages state lands from there
[2024-01-25 20:27] <tokam> the snap tries to install now
[2024-01-25 20:27] <tokam> think it will work
[2024-01-25 20:27] <tokam> Could I see the output of: ls -al /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-linux.so.2 on a non broken system? And what is the package that handles symlinks for libs?
[2024-01-25 20:28] <leftyfb> tokam: if you are messing with that file and it's out of place, you are doing very very bad things and unless you know what you are doing, re-install
[2024-01-25 20:28] <leftyfb> it should not be a link
[2024-01-25 20:29] <tokam> well for me it is not a link... so as I have zoom installed now we just ignore that for now I guess
[2024-01-25 20:30] <leftyfb> ignore what?
[2024-01-25 20:30] <tokam> symlink related errors from this pastebin https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BYFTTnTTHz/
[2024-01-25 20:30] <leftyfb> are you still getting those errors and if so, after running what command?
[2024-01-25 20:31] <tokam> they occured after trying to install the downloaded zoom package from their website
[2024-01-25 20:31] <leftyfb> tokam: are you still getting errors when you try to install an application using apt?
[2024-01-25 20:32] <tokam> yes one second, I will create a pastebin
[2024-01-25 20:32] <tokam> what is a correct locale for LANG? en_US and en did not work well
[2024-01-25 20:33] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/qcdf525j8P/

[2024-01-25 20:43] <leftyfb> you can try
[2024-01-25 20:44] <tokam> I would lose: composer, jsonlint, php-apcu, php-cgi, php-gettext, php-json-schema, php-pear, php-php-gettext, php-xdebug and many more

[2024-01-25 20:45] <leftyfb> it will tell you

[2024-01-25 20:49] <tokam> do I?
[2024-01-25 20:50] <tokam> I don't want to delete the 5.6 yet, I might have very old code that is not comptible with others
[2024-01-25 20:50] <tokam> I uninstalled libapache2-mod-php temporarily to fix the issues
[2024-01-25 20:51] <leftyfb> tokam: 5.6?
[2024-01-25 20:51] <tokam> veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery old code :D
[2024-01-25 20:51] <leftyfb> 5.6 of what package?
[2024-01-25 20:52] <leftyfb> I would stick all this ancient, insecure and unsupported php development into an LXD container and not muck up your main workstation with it
[2024-01-25 20:53] <leftyfb> or continue with your mess any not have the ability to update or install any new packages
[2024-01-25 21:09] <tokam> leftyfb: so my old php version is the root of the problems?
[2024-01-25 21:10] <leftyfb> tokam: that's where I'm leaning
[2024-01-25 21:10] <leftyfb> can't help further, sorry. Got meetings for the rest of the evening
[2024-01-25 21:14] <pragmaticenigma> tokam: typically mode code should port to the new version with small adjustments. If you follow the migration documentation for PHP and don't see anything mentioned under deprecated features from 5.6 on up to the latest, that would apply to your code, you should have little difficulty in using the latest PHP version with your code.

[2024-01-25 21:21] <shoreditch-samur> hi, does anyone else have the problem where the laptop is always on Power Saver mode and can't switch to a different mode from the GNOME panel? I'm on Ubuntu 23.10
[2024-01-25 21:25] <pragmaticenigma> shoreditch-samur: a search result found this: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1448538/why-is-power-settings-not-working-in-ubuntu-22-04-why-dont-i-have-performance
[2024-01-25 21:25] <pragmaticenigma> so yes, someone else has it
[2024-01-25 21:25] <pragmaticenigma> or something similar to your problem
[2024-01-25 21:27] <shoreditch-samur> thanks. I've seen this before but it doesn't have an actual solution. For me, even the powerprofilesctl doesn't switch the modes
[2024-01-25 21:30] <pragmaticenigma> you could try changing from the command line using `powerprofilectl`
[2024-01-25 21:31] <pragmaticenigma> it might provide more answers as to what prevents a change
[2024-01-25 21:34] <shoreditch-samur> yes, doesn't do much - https://paste.opensuse.org/pastes/a63f6899e847
[2024-01-25 21:35] <pragmaticenigma> more than likely because they both use the same conduit to sending the signa
[2024-01-25 21:35] <pragmaticenigma> *signal
[2024-01-25 21:37] <pragmaticenigma> shoreditch-samur: the only things that come to mind is to check if there is a setting in BIOS/UEFI settings that prevents the OS from making changes to power profiles. Or start monitoring logs when you toggle the switch to see if dmesg or syslogs emit any help error messages. Everything that I was able to search for points to same question, no one attempting to troubleshoot or post logs.
[2024-01-25 21:39] <shoreditch-samur> alright thanks
[2024-01-25 22:05] <JanC> shoreditch-samur: did you check temperatures also?
[2024-01-26 00:08] <tizaz> why does my browser not open. it says input/output error
[2024-01-26 03:31] <noalternative> I need help writing windows install usb in ubuntu.   I need to repair Windows in dual boot.
[2024-01-26 03:31] <noalternative> I have tried boot-repair  but it  did'nt work
[2024-01-26 03:31] <noalternative> I have also woeusb but get errors.
[2024-01-26 03:32] <noalternative> Can anyone help with this?  I am running 22.04
[2024-01-26 05:21] <alien> hi
[2024-01-26 05:46] <peirik> How do you guys keep track of which package manager you used to install a certain app?
[2024-01-26 05:46] <rbox> which?
[2024-01-26 05:46] <peirik> Example, I have Sublime Text installed. But I don't remember if I installed using brew, apt or snap
[2024-01-26 05:47] <rbox> thats easy, dont use brew
[2024-01-26 05:47] <peirik> Now I need to check each of those "stores" to see which one was used
[2024-01-26 05:47] <rbox> and dpkg will tell you whats been installed with apt
[2024-01-26 05:47] <peirik> ok, forget brew then
[2024-01-26 05:47] <peirik> there's still apt, snap and flathub
[2024-01-26 05:48] <peirik> and its still a pain to figure out each time which source the app was installed from
[2024-01-26 05:48] <peirik> it would be great if the OS could keep track of this for me
[2024-01-26 05:48] <rbox> keep track?
[2024-01-26 05:48] <rbox> does ubuntu even ship with flathub support?
[2024-01-26 05:48] <peirik> like an "installed apps" list, with quick info about each installed app (where its located on disk, and from which source it was installed)=
[2024-01-26 05:49] <wwacko> rbox, does rascul keep track?
[2024-01-26 06:11] <wwacko> any yall nerds got tux tattoos?
[2024-01-26 08:12] <that_guy> hello
[2024-01-26 08:12] <that_guy> anybody
[2024-01-26 09:31] <GeekShadow> Hello, I installed Ubuntu 22.04 with default Gnome on my computer in French, but I have some part untranslated...
[2024-01-26 09:31] <GeekShadow> eg : http://lutim.anartist.org/D1SPdCIm.jpg http://lutim.anartist.org/TXao9hGE.jpg
[2024-01-26 09:32] <GeekShadow> is there another package I need to install to have those translated ?
[2024-01-26 09:35] <wwacko> im not a pro or anything but the old addage holds true - you get what you pay for
[2024-01-26 09:52] <lotuspsychje> GeekShadow: did you check gnomes settings/languages if you got the translation pack installed?
[2024-01-26 10:10] <cart_> Hi. I am trying to reinstall my Ubuntu ontop of my already existing UBuntu. All forms of "Upgrade" failed and I now resort to lambasting the setup and trying to keep all my files at the same time
[2024-01-26 10:12] <cart_> Problem is.. I am already dual booting so in the setup I choose "Install Ubuntu 23.10.1 alongside them"  (Them meaning Windows). I then then click on the blue text that says "advanced pertitioning tool"  BUT nothing happens when I click it
[2024-01-26 10:12] <cart_> It just does not do anuthing and stays at the screen
[2024-01-26 10:12] <cart_> Can I launch it in another terminal or something?
[2024-01-26 10:43] <nameful> hi all.is it safe to empty the contents of folder journal? it is under /var/log/journal
[2024-01-26 10:45] <oerheks> nameful, no, if you want to clean out journal, see https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/12/clear-systemd-journal-logs-ubuntu/
[2024-01-26 10:45] <oerheks> first rotate, then clean with vacuum
[2024-01-26 10:46] <oerheks> normally it would not grow , as set in  /etc/systemd/journald.conf
[2024-01-26 10:46] <nameful> it is already at 3gb,is that still normal?
[2024-01-26 10:47] <nameful> ill check the link.tnx oerheks
[2024-01-26 10:47] <oerheks> mine is 1.9 now ..
[2024-01-26 10:48] <nameful> what about the folder snaps,is it safe to empty it? located at /var/lib/snapd
[2024-01-26 10:49] <oerheks> no, remove the snaps with sudo snap remove  --purge <package>
[2024-01-26 10:50] <pagios>  how can i tell the bootloader that i have a luks partition to decrypt? when booting it is not asking for decryption asd seeinf the disk as corrupt since encrypted
[2024-01-26 10:50] <nameful> ok,another folder to skip then
[2024-01-26 10:52] <wwacko> whats the maximum number of a megabytes ubuntu supports?
[2024-01-26 11:22] <seravitae> Hello, I was wondering if someone could potentially point me in the right direction of different places I can capture evidence for a bug. It appears quite serious - using Thunar/engrampa to open zip files undertakes strange behaviors including extracting files that were not intended, crashing with a general protection fault, and it also on several occasions destroyed unrelated data in the same directory.
[2024-01-26 11:23] <seravitae> I'm not sure which application is causing it, thus I don't know which team's website to file the report.
[2024-01-26 11:44] <wwacko> did dell work with you guys on their linux line?
[2024-01-26 11:51] <fweht> when i print a file from a pdf (evince) to a location, why does it forget which location i used the last time when i open a different pdf?  isnt it a common usecase that i want to extract excerpts from different pdfs into a single folder?  also i have no "recent locations" tab..
[2024-01-26 12:50] <dob1> what is the channel about snap packages ?
[2024-01-26 12:51] <lotuspsychje> !snap
[2024-01-26 12:51] <ubottu> Snaps are containerised software packages similar to Flatpaks and AppImages. For more info, see https://snapcraft.io
[2024-01-26 12:51] <lotuspsychje> !snappy
[2024-01-26 12:51] <ubottu> Ubuntu Core is a version of Ubuntu with transactional updates completely built from snap packages (also see !snap). For discussion and support, please visit #snappy and see https://ubuntu.com/core
[2024-01-26 12:54] <dob1> ok snappy
[2024-01-26 12:54] <dob1> thanks
[2024-01-26 13:04] <cart_> Hi. I am trying to reinstall my Ubuntu ontop of my already existing UBuntu. All forms of "Upgrade" failed and I now resort to lambasting the setup and trying to keep all my files at the same time

[2024-01-26 13:05] <pragmaticenigma> Why not use the live disk to move your files from your ubuntu partition to somewhere safe? Then just reuse your previous Ubuntu partition?
[2024-01-26 13:06] <cart_> pragmaticenigma: Because I do not have the space
[2024-01-26 13:06] <cart_> I have done this before.
[2024-01-26 13:06] <cart_> you install ubuntu just ontop of the older one
[2024-01-26 13:07] <cart_> Worked fine in the past
[2024-01-26 13:10] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-26 13:38] <Poppiflower> Hey I have a quick question (hopefully). I am testing some hopefully not so invasive device assurance tools for a company, and without making any modifications to the ubuntu image, have installed it on a laptop and installed the device assurance tool. When running, it shows that XServer-xephyr is running a remote access service, and while I
[2024-01-26 13:38] <Poppiflower> understand what X server is, not quite sure I understand what xserver-xephyr is and why it needs that remote port. If we were to ask our employees to uninstall that, would that be catastrophic to users, or is there a reason why it needs to have a listening port showing up?
[2024-01-26 13:39] <pragmaticenigma> Poppiflower: You cannot remove that without disrupting the system. The correct approach would be to make sure the filewall does not allow remote access to that port
[2024-01-26 13:40] <pragmaticenigma> Poppiflower: A proper test would be to remotely attack the system. Why are you trying to pen test it from inside? That's like trying to break into your own home while inside.
[2024-01-26 13:41] <pragmaticenigma> filewall should be firewall
[2024-01-26 13:41] <Poppiflower> I am just doing really basic checks for things that the service finds as running - trying to understand the baseline of what the tool catches and flags for, not necessarily Ubuntu. Not trying to attach from the inside, just get a better understanding. :)
[2024-01-26 13:41] <ogra_> the question is really, why does it run ?
[2024-01-26 13:42] <ogra_> it should definitely not ... at least by default
[2024-01-26 13:43] <Poppiflower> So... xserver-xephyr shouldn't be running by default? I just installed this grabbing 22.04.3, using the full install, and it appears to run by default after installation is complete.
[2024-01-26 13:43] <pragmaticenigma> Poppiflower: Do not mess with it
[2024-01-26 13:43] <Poppiflower> The only other thing I have done is update all software packages, but, I wouldn't consider that abnormal/
[2024-01-26 13:43] <Poppiflower> I don't plan on it :)
[2024-01-26 13:43] <Poppiflower> Like I said, just trying to understand the cause, not fix the problem.
[2024-01-26 13:44] <pragmaticenigma> XServer-xephyr is a nested Xserver. It allows an applications to draw a new window without stealing focus from other windows. Like Firefox wants to display an error message. If it runs inside the nested instance, then it can display all the pop-ups and error messages it wants to, without disturbing the user while they are working in LibreOffice
[2024-01-26 13:44] <pragmaticenigma> (that's a very crude understanding I have of it)
[2024-01-26 13:44] <Poppiflower> That is a better understanding than I had.. and that also makes a lot of sense. :)
[2024-01-26 13:45] <pragmaticenigma> Soon it won't be a problem when Wayland is the only option installed by default.
[2024-01-26 13:46] <Poppiflower> If the operating system is already using wayland though - is it normal for that to then be running?
[2024-01-26 13:46] <Poppiflower> if the installation* , not Operating System
[2024-01-26 13:46] <pragmaticenigma> Yes, as not all programs are fully compatibile with Wayland. And to use XWayland compatibility, requires an Xserver instance
[2024-01-26 13:47] <Poppiflower> Alrighty. I'll bring that back to the device assurance tool we are testing and see what they say about changing their check for that when testing against running services or open ports.
[2024-01-26 13:47] <Poppiflower> Thank you very much both of you!
[2024-01-26 13:49] <pragmaticenigma> That's the problem with scanning tools... It's assumed they're turnkey solutions, when they're anything but. They need to be tuned, and honestly, if a tool flags a "problem" but can't offer an explanation of what something is used for, then it's a bad tool
[2024-01-26 13:50] <Poppiflower> It does offer an explanation, but, not an explanation I like :DÂ And their explanation would have broken the system.
[2024-01-26 13:50] <Poppiflower> I am aware that this is not going to be turnkey - especially on linux but, I also want to double check what I find before assuming the wrong thing.
[2024-01-26 13:50] <Poppiflower> I figured that removing this would have been a bad idea, but - I could have been wrong.:D
[2024-01-26 13:51] <pragmaticenigma> In my experience a lot of those tools make use of "well-known" types of documents to assume what is what. That's why at the beginning I said, a tool needs to scan from the outside to make sure all ingress points a locked down. Scanning from the inside is very much like calling an open window a security risk, even though you are on the inside too and you opened the window for some fresh air.
[2024-01-26 13:51] <Poppiflower> Re: the tool, we are looking at Kolide / OSQuery, so we have a lot of leeway with that, but, was just wanting to look at what their primary checks would find vs what we would have to write ourselves.
[2024-01-26 13:53] <pragmaticenigma> The "well-known" may say that port 80 is an HTTP server. But if there are no HTTP servers installed, then something else has co-opted that port and should be interogated before telling the user, they have a web server running.
[2024-01-26 13:53] <pragmaticenigma> Or it may assume apache is installed, when NGinx is
[2024-01-26 13:53] <Poppiflower> Of course, but in our situation, if anything is running on port 80, whether it is apache, nginx, some random tool that isn't a web server, we don't want it accessing corporate services at all. So trying to find that even middle ground.
[2024-01-26 13:54] <pragmaticenigma> At least you have an organization that understands tuning is needed.
[2024-01-26 13:54] <Poppiflower> Only sometimes. :D Have to pick your battles. :D
[2024-01-26 13:54] <TomyWork> can anyone recommend a good SIP client for (k)ubuntu 22.04? I used to use yate, but that vanished from the repos between 18.04 and 22.04. I tried gnome-calls, but that doesn't use my VPN IP as the source IP, so it isn't able to connect. I tried jami, which can connect but then can't make audio calls due to an "Unsupported media type", probably owing to the crummy pbx software we're using
[2024-01-26 13:55] <pragmaticenigma> Poppiflower: for that one, make sure that they understand a device under test needs to have an external check as well, to verify that the open service is local to the machine.
[2024-01-26 13:57] <pragmaticenigma> TomyWork: For recommendations, please ask in the Offtopic channel #ubuntu-offtopic
[2024-01-26 14:00] <pagios> hi all,  i am reading about PXE boots, and i see that this is the image used for network boot. it is a small one and i am wondering what needs to be modified to allow a full KALI ISOO to be installed instead of a mimimal one. if i understand correctly this will mainly boot kali on the network but install FILES over the internet. which i dont want. i would like to use my locally hosted kali setup server https://http.kali.org/kali/dists/kali-rolling/main/in

[2024-01-26 14:00] <ubottu> pagios: The Ubuntu channels can only provide support for Ubuntu and its official !flavors.

[2024-01-26 14:14] <pragmaticenigma> pagios: Linux refers to the kernel, not the operating system. A distribution is a collection of software packages that are curated, and sometimes maintained by a group of people or company to create a fully operating system that operates using the linux kernel. Some distributions borrow from others in the spirit of open source, but usually with a different goal or purpose in mind. This difference is why something like Kali is not
[2024-01-26 14:14] <pragmaticenigma> supported here. The volunteers here may not be monitoring or aware of the design decisions behind how Kali is constructed. Kali is one of the biggest departures from mainline Ubuntu there is. In the end, what you should be doing is finding the most concentrated area to ask your question that is going to have the most people with the same topic in mind. That's not here.
[2024-01-26 14:15] <pagios> ok
[2024-01-26 14:16] <leftyfb> pragmaticenigma: pagios has been asking about other distro's in here for years. They get it. They just choose not to

[2024-01-26 14:25] <Thermoriax> May I interrupt the fight with ubuntu question? :) Recently the software updater has started offering me ubuntu pro stuff instead of the usual "all up to date" or "need to reboot" messages. I don't thiiink I clicked on anything to suggest I want them, and I'd rather it just go back to the usual behavior. Any ideas?
[2024-01-26 14:26] <wwacko> im an angry nerd from massachusetts with a gay tux tatoo and a fat ugly wife
[2024-01-26 14:27] <pragmaticenigma> Thermoriax: It's Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. They made a design choice to put "ads" in the update tools.
[2024-01-26 14:27] <leftyfb> Thermoriax: there's unfortunately nothing that can be done about that at the moment
[2024-01-26 14:28] <Thermoriax> pragmaticenigma: Ah, what a great way to convince me to switch from ubuntu.
[2024-01-26 14:28] <pragmaticenigma> Thermoriax: I'm right there with you
[2024-01-26 14:29] <Thermoriax> Anyway, thanks for the explaination...I thought mybe I'd accidentally set an option somewhere or something.
[2024-01-26 14:29] <pragmaticenigma> Thermoriax: Ubuntu Pro is free for personal use, on up to 5 machines. Once the machine is enrolled, I believe those messages should go away.
[2024-01-26 14:30] <Thermoriax> What's to keep them from deciding it's not free later?
[2024-01-26 14:31] <leftyfb> Thermoriax: you should read up on what ubuntu pro is https://www.howtogeek.com/902519/what-is-ubuntu-pro/
[2024-01-26 14:32] <pragmaticenigma> Thermoriax: That's a tomorrow problem. Today I will hope they continue to honor their statement from nearly 20 years ago, that Ubuntu will always be made free and remain free
[2024-01-26 14:32] <leftyfb> Thermoriax: if they decide to charge for it for personal use, then absolutely nothing changes as far as package updates on your machine
[2024-01-26 14:32] <Thermoriax> Good luck with. I think I'm going to use this as motivation to go through with my 'immutable distro' curiousity.

[2024-01-26 15:19] <pragmaticenigma> ogra_: It's not that general. The business has to be owned by the user to be elligible.

[2024-01-26 15:24] <pragmaticenigma> perhaps not, but providing accurate information is something that should be cared about
[2024-01-26 15:24] <ogra_> (so if you have fifty customers you are an admin of, each of them running an ubuntu fileserver and three workstations in their office, you just create an account per customer and have them get the free security updates ... nobody will come after you)

[2024-01-26 16:11] <CoolDude65> All three show up in the BIOS but only two of them show up with `lsblk` or `fdisk -l`:

[2024-01-26 16:15] <CoolDude65> Sorry about that.
[2024-01-26 16:15] <CoolDude65> I'm having some hardware trouble: my M.2 SSD shows up in BIOS but not in Ubuntu
[2024-01-26 16:15] <CoolDude65> I have three M.2 NVME SSD's plugged into my motherboard.
[2024-01-26 16:15] <CoolDude65> All three show up in the BIOS (see screenshot https://imgur.com/a/YLwJQ6W) but only two of them show up with `lsblk` or `fdisk -l` (https://dpaste.com/4NUVLGRNU).
[2024-01-26 16:15] <CoolDude65> The third SSD is brand new. How can I get Ubuntu to recognize it?
[2024-01-26 16:15] <Pricey> How can you get ufw to allow icmpv6 messages, e.g. router solicitation? I've been disabling the default ufw allow/in/fwd rules and allowing only specific paths. So far so good, ipv4 all working fine. Then I notice my lxd guests can't obtain ipv6 slaac addresses...
[2024-01-26 16:18] <leftyfb> CoolDude65: what release of ubuntu?
[2024-01-26 16:18] <CoolDude65> leftyfb: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
[2024-01-26 16:19] <leftyfb> CoolDude65: what kernel?
[2024-01-26 16:19] <CoolDude65> leftyfb: 6.5.0-15-generic
[2024-01-26 16:20] <cahoots_> hi, when i do 'ls a*' and hit tab twice, it doesn't show me all suggestions that start with "a". any ideas how to fix?
[2024-01-26 16:20] <cahoots_> as in, when i type 'ls a*' but don't hit enter, just tab twice
[2024-01-26 16:21] <Pricey> cahoots_: try 'ls a' and hit tab
[2024-01-26 16:21] <Pricey> (The * might work in some other shell... but you'll be in bash which I don't think works that way)
[2024-01-26 16:21] <cahoots_> Pricey, this is not always what i want, though. for example, if i do 'ls *.cpp' and hit tab twice, i want to see all files ending in ".cpp". bash on macos works just like this
[2024-01-26 16:22] <ritterworld> Hi :)Â I'm having a challenge with an Audio Interface Focusrite Clarett+ 2Pre and Ubuntu 23.10 mantic with 6.7.2-060702-generic #202401251943 installed through mainline. I use https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui to configure it. and i can see in it as well as in alsamixer that i have 12 PCM Inputs, they all have signal, they are
[2024-01-26 16:22] <ritterworld> processing etc. but in the Sound Settings I dont see any Input Device. is there a way of how to add a specific PCM Input there?
[2024-01-26 16:23] <pragmaticenigma> cahoots_: when you type in 'ls a*' and then try to tab complete, it's trying to tab complete files that start with the litteral characters 'a' and '*' ... the astrixs is a wild card that is interpreted by ls, not the command line.
[2024-01-26 16:24] <cahoots_> pragmaticenigma, why would this work differently in macos bash, then? i haven't changed any configuration around auto-complete in either ubuntu bash or macos bash
[2024-01-26 16:24] <ritterworld> maybe a differenct bashrc ?
[2024-01-26 16:25] <pragmaticenigma> cahoots_: it's apple, known for doing things "differently" ... I have no idea how they configured their terminal environment
[2024-01-26 16:25] <pragmaticenigma> it might not even be bash
[2024-01-26 16:25] <Pricey> cahoots_: Are you sure you're using bash on macos? Doesn't it default to zsh or something these days?
[2024-01-26 16:25] <ritterworld> cahoots_ and even if the bashrc is the same maybe the command used to do certain thing is in a differnt version/flavour on bash
[2024-01-26 16:26] <Pricey> cahoots_: "echo $SHELL" on macos. I think you'll find it's /bin/zsh. Yes, that behaviour works for me on macos
[2024-01-26 16:26] <Pricey> cahoots_: If you want to change your shell on ubuntu, that's possible, but a different question.
[2024-01-26 16:29] <lotuspsychje> GeekShadow: some parts of gnome are not fully translated in some languages, maybe you can bring it up in #ubuntu-translators
[2024-01-26 16:29] <cahoots_> Pricey, "echo $SHELL" shows the default shell, but that's not the same thing as the currently running shell. for me, "echo $0" returns "-bash"
[2024-01-26 16:30] <cahoots_> yeah, this may be a version difference for bash or something
[2024-01-26 16:30] <Pricey> cahoots_: On macos, "echo $SHELL" by default should return "/bin/zsh". I don't know what you mean by "the default shell".
[2024-01-26 16:30] <pragmaticenigma> Um, considering you're using `echo $0` instead of `echo $SHELL` for macos, should be the first clue things are different.
[2024-01-26 16:31] <Pricey> cahoots_: Yes, bash and zsh behave differently. It sounds like you've got zsh on macos and bash on ubuntu. That's the immediate reason your tab completion works differently.
[2024-01-26 16:37] <ritterworld> I'm having a challenge with an USB Audio Interface Focusrite Clarett+ 2Pre and Ubuntu 23.10 mantic with 6.7.2-060702-generic #202401251943 installed through mainline. I use https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui to configure it. And I can see in it as well as in alsamixer that i have 12 PCM Inputs, they all have signal (basically the
[2024-01-26 16:37] <ritterworld> routing is correct), they are processing etc. but in the Ubuntu Sound Settings I don't see any Input Device. is there a way of how to add a specific PCM Input there?
[2024-01-26 16:38] <cahoots_> i do not have zsh on macos. it's using bash
[2024-01-26 16:39] <cahoots_> that is, zsh exists on macos, but i'm using bash
[2024-01-26 16:42] <pragmaticenigma> cahoots_: if `echo $SHELL` does not return the path to bash, you are not using bash. You might be running bash inside of zsh, and when bash cannot complete a command, the command is bubbled up to the host environment for execution or to throw an exception.
[2024-01-26 16:45] <pragmaticenigma> in any case, the answer to your question is that your approach to tab complete `ls a*` will not yield the expected result, because there isn't anything supported that ability to perform that action. the tab completion uses what is typed in as a string litteral, it doesn't interpret it further. so your `ls a*` and tabing is attempting to find something in the current working environment that starts with the two characters 'a' and '*'

[2024-01-26 18:08] <duckx0r> I used the Muon package manager to lock a package to a specific version, but when I try to release the lock, I get the message "The package code could not be locked. Failed to write lock file." also `sudo apt-mark showhold` is empty. What type of lock is being placed on this package and how can I remove the lock?
[2024-01-26 18:57] <arraybolt3> I keep finding myself doing things like `sudo apt install virtualbox=biglongversionstring` in order to install something from -proposed. It looks like I could just do `sudo apt install virtualbox=mantic-proposed` or the like. Is that actually possible?
[2024-01-26 18:57] <arraybolt3> (can't confirm it myself right now since I'm already mid-install)

[2024-01-27 04:53] <oerheks> step 8, there i read something about ip adress
[2024-01-27 04:53] <jawad> even before this step
[2024-01-27 04:54] <jawad> Initially I though there is an issue with my system (hardware)
[2024-01-27 04:54] <jawad> I am trying it on another laptop, again facing same issue
[2024-01-27 04:55] <jawad> I think there is something wrong from step 1 to step 7
[2024-01-27 04:58] <jawad> each time I have to reinstall ubuntu
[2024-01-27 05:01] <jawad> Can you do anything?
[2024-01-27 05:01] <jawad> in this regard
[2024-01-27 05:02] <thisisjaymehta> I dont know anything about appium but its worth checking if appium puts your wifi into monitor mode.
[2024-01-27 05:02] <jawad> Can you check it?
[2024-01-27 05:05] <thisisjaymehta> I dont have a spare ubuntu system to experiment on. But try restarting using network manager using: `service network-manager restart` and then `ifconfig wlan0 up`. Note: Name of your wireless card might be different than wlan0, in that case use that name.
[2024-01-27 05:06] <jawad> ok

[2024-01-27 05:11] <jawad> its separate system, I have restarted it
[2024-01-27 05:12] <thisisjaymehta> Just restart network manager and then ifconfig wlan0 up
[2024-01-27 05:12] <jawad> I also executed ifconfig, I noticed there is waydroid0 instead of wlan0
[2024-01-27 05:12] <jawad> waydroid is one thing I have installed in appium guide

[2024-01-27 05:19] <jawad> yes now there is waydroid0 again in ifconfig
[2024-01-27 05:20] <jawad> now there are 5 devices

[2024-01-27 15:49] <lotuspsychje> at bottom driver=.....willshowup here
[2024-01-27 15:52] <Bombo> lotuspsychje: driver=amdgpu hm
[2024-01-27 15:52] <Bombo> so i guess it's the new driver i installed with amdgpu-installer
[2024-01-27 15:53] <lotuspsychje> Bombo: amdgpu driver should be loaded as module by default based on your graphics card
[2024-01-27 15:54] <lotuspsychje> what tutorial did you follow to do something else?
[2024-01-27 15:55] <Bombo> lotuspsychje: https://www.amd.com/de/support/linux-drivers https://amdgpu-install.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install-script.html
[2024-01-27 15:56] <Bombo> lotuspsychje: the card worked before, it used xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu
[2024-01-27 15:57] <Bombo> lotuspsychje: but RDNA was not working, but after that amdgpu-installer it doesn't work either
[2024-01-27 15:58] <Bombo> how can i test the features of my amdgpu then
[2024-01-27 15:58] <Bombo> list
[2024-01-27 15:58] <lotuspsychje> Bombo: i would start with the amdgpu module loaded by default from ubuntu
[2024-01-27 15:59] <oerheks> and for what ubuntu version?
[2024-01-27 15:59] <lotuspsychje> Bombo: if you got things not working from there, you can start debug
[2024-01-27 15:59] <Bombo> lotuspsychje: i did nothing and it worked, but not the RDNA part (blender says)
[2024-01-27 16:00] <Bombo> lotuspsychje: before there was only xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu installed
[2024-01-27 16:00] <Bombo> anyone with an AMD GPU knows how to list features to see if RDNA is enabled?
[2024-01-27 16:00] <oerheks> maybe that is part of amdgpu-pro?
[2024-01-27 16:02] <Bombo> what did i install then?
[2024-01-27 16:02] <Bombo> there is a pro version?
[2024-01-27 16:03] <lotuspsychje> Bombo: oerheks asked you wich ubuntu release
[2024-01-27 16:03] <lotuspsychje> amdgpu driver version would be handy and blender version tested too
[2024-01-27 16:03] <oerheks> pro is just a bibairy blob,  on top of amdgpu
[2024-01-27 16:03] <oerheks> c/binairy
[2024-01-27 16:04] <oerheks> yeah, ubuntu version, kernel and gpu info would be a minimum
[2024-01-27 16:04] <Bombo> oh i did not see that sorry, its 22.04 jammy
[2024-01-27 16:04] <Bombo> blender 4.0.2
[2024-01-27 16:05] <Bombo> AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.html say 'Radeon RX 6000 Series' 'with Linux: Radeon Software 22.10 or ROCm 5.3'

[2024-01-27 16:13] <oerheks> same version, good
[2024-01-27 16:14] <oerheks> then i have no clue why RDNA 2 is not enabled
[2024-01-27 16:15] <lotuspsychje> https://www.phoronix.com/review/blender-32-gpus
[2024-01-27 16:16] <Bombo> maybe it's blender's fault so i ask if there is an othe rway to check
[2024-01-27 16:16] <Bombo> if feature is enabled or not
[2024-01-27 16:22] <oerheks> maybe #blender is a help
[2024-01-27 16:22] <lotuspsychje> Bombo: can you do some tests with the blender snap perhaps
[2024-01-27 16:23] <lotuspsychje> latest/stable or latest/edge
[2024-01-27 16:26] <Bombo> i suspect it's a drivre issue so i wanted to try it with another tool, that uses RDNA
[2024-01-27 16:46] <BinarySavior> is there any program i can run on a micro sd card which is not detected when inserted into reader?
[2024-01-27 16:46] <BinarySavior> other micro sd cards work
[2024-01-27 16:46] <BinarySavior> just this one is not detected
[2024-01-27 16:46] <BinarySavior> or is it fried
[2024-01-27 16:47] <Paris> try gparted, or in another device, most likely it's a dead card.
[2024-01-27 16:48] <leftyfb> BinarySavior: if it doesn't show up in dmesg, then it's dead
[2024-01-27 16:50] <Paris> check the contacts also, there can be crap preventing connection. Sometimes a card might read onto another device, then backup it, and change it.
[2024-01-27 17:31] <JanC> BinarySavior: what do you mean by "not detected"?
[2024-01-27 17:34] <Bombo> *doh* sudo usermod -a -G render $LOGNAME was missing, now it works
[2024-01-27 17:34] <user_> hello
[2024-01-27 17:48] <plujon> Good day.
[2024-01-27 17:49] <plujon> Recently my Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system stopped fully powering off.  I asked about this the other day, thinking this was a problem with suspend, but when I shut down my computer yesterday, the fan stayed on as did activity lights in the front and back.  Any ideas what might cause this behavior and how I can troubleshoot it?
[2024-01-27 17:53] <lotuspsychje> plujon: you can press F1 at shutdown process to switch to textmode, see where it bottlenecks
[2024-01-27 17:55] <plujon> lotuspsychje: Thanks; I'll try that.  But I think my display goes black.
[2024-01-27 17:56] <plujon> Not too long ago, I got two new hard drives: 1 nvme and 1 classic platter.  I don't know if that is a contributor somehow.
[2024-01-27 17:57] <plujon> I also updated Ubuntu recently, and I might have gotten a newer kernel, and I moved Virtual Box versions from 6.x to 7.0.
[2024-01-27 17:57] <plujon> So, my three leading suspects are: 1. hard drive(s), 2. kernel upgrade, 3. virtual box upgrade.  But I have no hard evidence for any of them.
[2024-01-27 17:58] <lotuspsychje> plujon: investigate your logs, share in a !paste with the volunteers
[2024-01-27 17:59] <lotuspsychje> usualy F1 text shutdown will give you an idea of whats happening last to your system, some cases you can catch a hang/freeze
[2024-01-27 18:00] <plujon> How can I view logs?
[2024-01-27 18:00] <lotuspsychje> try the F1 trick first
[2024-01-27 18:00] <plujon> I've already looked at journalctl, for example.
[2024-01-27 18:00] <lotuspsychje> see how far you can reach your shutdown
[2024-01-27 18:02] <plujon> Okay, I'll try the F1 trick.  I guess I'll have to write down what I see, if anything.  I fear the screen will go black and I won't have much to go on.  We'll see.
[2024-01-27 18:02] <plujon> And, ... the problem does not occur on every shutdown.
[2024-01-27 18:09] <plujon> The computer shut down normally.
[2024-01-27 18:09] <plujon> The last thing on the screen before the monitor went black was something about evicting inodes.
[2024-01-27 18:14] <plujon> The amount of time to read the screen before the monitor goes dark is rather short.  Is it possible to make Linux shut down components in a different order, or to shut down everything except the display?
[2024-01-27 18:17] <pragmaticenigma> plujon: are you running in a VM?
[2024-01-27 18:18] <BinarySavior> JanC, I mean it's not mounted when i plug it in like other cards
[2024-01-27 18:19] <JanC> BinarySavior: but it shows up in Gnome Disks?
[2024-01-27 18:19] <plujon> pragmaticenigma: Not right now, but I often do.
[2024-01-27 18:19] <BinarySavior> JanC, no it doesn't show up in gnome disks either
[2024-01-27 18:19] <plujon> I could try starting and stopping a virtualbox vm, and then seeing if my host fails to shutdown.
[2024-01-27 18:20] <pragmaticenigma> plujon: when you installed the new drives, did you copy data from the old onto the new, or did you do a fresh install.
[2024-01-27 18:20] <JanC> BinarySavior: and nothing in the journal or dmesg either?
[2024-01-27 18:20] <BinarySavior> JanC, i didn't check journal or dmesg
[2024-01-27 18:20] <BinarySavior> I just ordered a new card, this one is 10 years old
[2024-01-27 18:20] <JanC> there might be errors there at the moment you plug it in
[2024-01-27 18:20] <plujon> pragmaticenigma: The new drives are not system drives; they hold only data.  I formatted them as ext4 and copied some files onto them using cp.
[2024-01-27 18:21] <plujon> I have one SSD plugged in that had started failing about a month ago, but it is not mounted (I removed it from /etc/fstab).
[2024-01-27 18:22] <plujon> I'm running 6.5.0-14-generic.  I also added a few kernel parameters:
[2024-01-27 18:23] <plujon> nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=0 pcie_aspm=off libata.noacpi=1 # I added these when I started to have problems with the failing NVME drive
[2024-01-27 18:23] <plujon> I guess those kernel parameters are suspect #4.
[2024-01-27 18:27] <pragmaticenigma> plujon: I would recommend removing the failing drive completely. Even though it's not being mounted, the kernel is still looking at it and trying to access parts of it
[2024-01-27 18:28] <plujon> pragmaticenigma: Even on shutdown?  Even with no mounted file system?  Interesting.
[2024-01-27 18:29] <pragmaticenigma> plujon: failing hardware can cause a lot of problems just being present. what ever is causing the drive to fail could very well be causing electrical noise or shorts in the system. Even with the drive unmounted, the kernel knows there is a drive there and will try to send a power up/down signal to that drive.
[2024-01-27 18:30] <pragmaticenigma> A failing drive should be immediately backed up, and then removed to prevent further potential data loss.
[2024-01-27 18:34] <BinarySavior> i have huge static build up on my body when sitting at my desk, i literally get shocked each time i touch something after sitting at my desk
[2024-01-27 18:35] <BinarySavior> pretty sure i fried my sd card with my own static
[2024-01-27 18:36] <pragmaticenigma> if it repeatedly happens, that's very likely BinarySavior. You might want to invest in a humidifier if the air is really dry where you are.
[2024-01-27 18:36] <plujon> pragmaticenigma: Ah, thanks.  I'll shutdown and remove the drive.
[2024-01-27 18:38] <OnkelTem> Hi folks. I give up on trying to get colors from GNOME Terminal. How can I get its color palette? Can I use dconf for that? Or should it be gsettings? Is it really - a CSS file?
[2024-01-27 18:38] <OnkelTem> Ubuntu 22.04 here
[2024-01-27 18:39] <Stefan1899> Search for ubuntu color code online
[2024-01-27 18:39] <JanC> BinarySavior: that is probably a result of the particular fabric of your clothes then (maybe combined with the fabric of your chair)?
[2024-01-27 18:39] <OnkelTem> Stefan1899: it's useless, I tired of googling
[2024-01-27 18:40] <lotuspsychje> OnkelTem: terminals got color schemes in settings
[2024-01-27 18:40] <OnkelTem> lotuspsychje: yep, I see them. I need the palette from the default "GNOME" built-in one
[2024-01-27 18:41] <lotuspsychje> OnkelTem: you mean the color codes from gnome terminal?
[2024-01-27 18:41] <OnkelTem> lotuspsychje: positive!
[2024-01-27 18:41] <OnkelTem> I'm pretty sure those built-in palettes should be stored somewhere, hopefully not in code
[2024-01-27 18:42] <OnkelTem> I just can't get them. I tried using dconf but meh... it didn't help and my familiarity with it is near zero
[2024-01-27 18:50] <plujon> I started and stopped a VM, shutdown was still clean.  I removed the failing nvme disk.
[2024-01-27 18:51] <pragmaticenigma> OnkelTem: I suspect the built in pallets are compiled into source. If only to avoid a user accidentally deleting or making a difficult to correct mistake
[2024-01-27 18:53] <pragmaticenigma> I thought the colors themselves got stored as environment variables when initializing the session
[2024-01-27 18:53] <OnkelTem> pragmaticenigma: as for the source - it's reasonable, yes. Do you have an idea where I can find the source?
[2024-01-27 18:54] <pragmaticenigma> For Gnome terminal? I imagine it's somewhere in their code repos: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME
[2024-01-27 18:55] <OnkelTem> pragmaticenigma: thanks!
[2024-01-27 18:55] <pragmaticenigma> OnkelTem: https://gitlab.gnome.org/explore might be a little better link
[2024-01-27 18:56] <plujon> I've also removed the custom kernel parameters.
[2024-01-27 18:56] <plujon> journalctl contains # kernel: NOHZ tick-stop error: local softirq work is pending, handler #200!!!
[2024-01-27 18:59] <plujon> I'll head over to #linux to ask about this error.
[2024-01-27 19:58] <navarro> ok

[2024-01-27 20:31] <olspookishmagus> flavors maybe?

[2024-01-27 22:23] <bprompt> allo allo
[2024-01-27 22:25] <meena> I just finally upgraded this laptop to 22.04, and for some reason, it prefers to install firefox from a snap package, rather than from the Mozilla PPA i added. How can I craft an apt preferences to prefer the PPA?
[2024-01-27 22:27] <meena> here's what apt-cache policy firefox looks like: https://gist.github.com/igalic/b594faa47755f03244932c6afde2cf43
[2024-01-27 22:28] <jeremy31> meena: https://www.kubuntuforums.net/forum/general/documentation/how-to-s/662503-how-to-set-priority-for-a-ppa-i-e-using-firefox-without-snapd
[2024-01-27 22:28] <xangua> As far as I know, he Mozilla PPA offers Firefox ESR meena, so you need to install that
[2024-01-27 22:28] <meena> xangua: I *want* the Beta.
[2024-01-27 22:28] <xangua> There's also a new Deb repository made by Mozilla
[2024-01-27 22:28] <JanC> it offers both ESR & latest release
[2024-01-27 22:30] <xangua> Ok
[2024-01-27 22:31] <JanC> I assume you mean https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions
[2024-01-27 22:32] <JanC> the explanation about priorities there is the same as what you need for the LP PPA... (except for the URLs, of course)
[2024-01-27 22:33] <JanC> although you might want to limit it to only firefox packages for safety reasons, I suppose...
[2024-01-27 22:35] <meena> beautiful. Thank you all for your help!
[2024-01-27 22:35] <meena> Next question: How do I destroy a luks crypted disk?
[2024-01-27 22:36] <meena> or rather, reuse it in the same setupâ¦ just get rid of the data
[2024-01-27 22:40] <meena> shred -n 1 /dev/sdb # this should probably do itâ¦
[2024-01-27 22:41] <rbox> wipefs is generally all you need

[2024-01-27 22:48] <mrpizza> new ubuntu user here, got a question regarding locating a file, if anyone has time to spare.

[2024-01-27 22:54] <mrpizza> I'm trying to locate pdx_settings.txt, settings.txt, system.log and error.log in my Stellaris files, but going to Documents using the graphic interface results in a "Folder is Empty" message. Tried to use locate in the command terminal to find the path to the wanted files, which should be in Documents/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/, but trying to
[2024-01-27 22:54] <mrpizza> install the function resulted in a return of "/usr/bin/find: '/run/user/1000/doc': Permission denied," as well as another similar result that had gvfs instead of doc.
[2024-01-27 22:55] <rbox> "install the function"?
[2024-01-27 22:56] <mrpizza> I was led to believe that one had to install the locate function via a sudo command.
[2024-01-27 22:57] <rbox> so what did you do
[2024-01-27 22:57] <mrpizza> sudo apt install locate
[2024-01-27 22:58] <rbox> and you got errors from find as a result of that?
[2024-01-27 22:59] <mrpizza> I didn't use find; was told that locate is for finding files where you don't know the directory they're in.
[2024-01-27 23:02] <rbox> you said "trying to install resulted in..."
[2024-01-27 23:03] <mrpizza> Yes. After using sudo apt install locate, that was when I got the return of /usr/bin/find: '/run/user/1000/doc': Permission denied and /usr/bin/find: '/run/user/1000/gvfs': Permission denied,

[2024-01-28 00:35] <oerheks> apt update & apt upgrade # shows something
[2024-01-28 00:37] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/P7dxQQNv4m/
[2024-01-28 00:37] <tokam> I wonder why php5 is still listed, after I removed it
[2024-01-28 00:38] <tokam> Package php8.1-cli which provides php-cli is not configured yet.
[2024-01-28 00:38] <tokam> I think this is a point to start?
[2024-01-28 00:38] <rbox> try apt install -f
[2024-01-28 00:38] <oerheks> what ppa did you add, ondrej?
[2024-01-28 00:39] <tokam> # dpkg-reconfigure php8.1-cli
[2024-01-28 00:39] <tokam> /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: php8.1-cli is broken or not fully installed
[2024-01-28 00:40] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/b2vMqJtZWw/
[2024-01-28 00:40] <oerheks> and paste sudo apt update too please?
[2024-01-28 00:40] <oerheks> to see sources
[2024-01-28 00:41] <rbox> and how did you get yourself in this situation in the first place?
[2024-01-28 00:41] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/HbrfzdVMsm/
[2024-01-28 00:41] <tokam> rbox: I did not use the system for a while. I don't know
[2024-01-28 00:41] <rbox> okay, and then what did you do after not using it
[2024-01-28 00:41] <tokam> trying to start apache
[2024-01-28 00:41] <rbox> and you did that by...
[2024-01-28 00:42] <oerheks> a proper apt update && apt dist-upgrade would be a good start
[2024-01-28 00:42] <oerheks> + reboot
[2024-01-28 00:42] <tokam> I had one major issue some years ago, which screamed for reinstall
[2024-01-28 00:42] <tokam> it's related to this issue /sbin/ldconfig.real: /lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-linux.so.2 is not a symbolic link
[2024-01-28 00:42] <rbox> so a year ago you had an issue, and you knew you needed to reinstall ,but yo dindt?
[2024-01-28 00:43] <tokam> my system once was broken, because there is some package that is usually active which creates symlinks between /usr/lib and /lib and it had a bug and required a lot of manual fixing
[2024-01-28 00:43] <tokam> I got it back "working"
[2024-01-28 00:43] <rbox> so your system was borken to begin with, and you're wondering why its still broken
[2024-01-28 00:43] <rbox> ?
[2024-01-28 00:43] <oerheks> oh so we need to fix that..
[2024-01-28 00:43] <tokam> but issues now could come from this still, I am not sure
[2024-01-28 00:43] <tokam> could be realted, but does not need to be related
[2024-01-28 00:44] <oerheks> reinstall, if you can reproduce it again, file a bugreport?
[2024-01-28 00:44] <tokam> :-/
[2024-01-28 00:44] <tokam> are you guys getting money from ubuntu foundation to help? or you are volunteers?
[2024-01-28 00:45] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/3fZs8xdkG4/
[2024-01-28 00:45] <tokam> Maybe to begin with I should remove all these packages?
[2024-01-28 00:47] <tokam> I am uninstalling now everything php related
[2024-01-28 00:48] <tokam> it says it will not delete this directory
[2024-01-28 00:48] <tokam> /etc/php/8.1/apache2/conf.d
[2024-01-28 00:49] <tokam> should I delete it manually?
[2024-01-28 00:49] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Q7ZMhMCS3F/
[2024-01-28 00:50] <oerheks> reinstall of that server is 5 minutes..
[2024-01-28 00:50] <tokam> It is my local machine, that I use for many years now
[2024-01-28 00:50] <tokam> reinstall would ruin my existance
[2024-01-28 00:50] <tokam> reinstall for every problem cannot be the solution?
[2024-01-28 00:51] <oerheks> well, if you have no backup, your data is not important
[2024-01-28 00:51] <oerheks> tokam, , you bring up and old machine with curious problems
[2024-01-28 00:51] <oerheks> did you do a proper update run first?
[2024-01-28 00:52] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/36qGQ96wYJ/
[2024-01-28 00:52] <tokam> this is how dist-upgrade looks now
[2024-01-28 00:52] <tokam> so it looks clean
[2024-01-28 00:53] <tokam> should I reboot before the next steps?
[2024-01-28 00:53] <oerheks> yes, rebot, i guess you get a fresh kernel and ssl update
[2024-01-28 00:53] <tokam> I think with php8.1 I run into this error and it needs a fix, but we can see it when we install php step by step?
[2024-01-28 00:53] <tokam> /sbin/ldconfig.real: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 is not a symbolic link
[2024-01-28 00:54] <tokam> Ok I reboot and come back
[2024-01-28 00:58] <tokam> Hi
[2024-01-28 00:58] <tokam> reboot worked. What should I install first?
[2024-01-28 01:01] <tokam> can I just delete /etc/php/8.1 ?
[2024-01-28 01:02] <tokam> i renamed it to 8.1_backup
[2024-01-28 01:05] <tokam> I run into the same issue

[2024-01-28 01:23] <rbox> take a fresh system, and try to instal lit
[2024-01-28 01:23] <rbox> does it still fail?
[2024-01-28 01:23] <tokam> its related to the gettext module
[2024-01-28 01:23] <tokam> or maybe some module named -r
[2024-01-28 01:23] <tokam> one sec
[2024-01-28 01:24] <tokam> yep it is named -r
[2024-01-28 01:24] <tokam> the variable in line 30 contains "-r"
[2024-01-28 01:24] <tokam> and with this module it breaks
[2024-01-28 01:24] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MJhgKPVqxS/
[2024-01-28 01:25] <tokam> can you tell me what is this -r from the phpquery -M -v 8.1 command and how to get rid of it or fix it?
[2024-01-28 01:27] <tokam> This is the post installation script. https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/TJDmgQdNjJ/ it breaks in line 30 when iterating over the variable $mod with "-r"
[2024-01-28 01:28] <tokam> I also asked in #php where does the command phpquery -M -v 8.1 get the modules from and what is this -r?
[2024-01-28 01:48] <tokam> The postinstall script executes this errornous command
[2024-01-28 01:48] <tokam> phpenmod -m -v 8.1 -s cli -q -r
[2024-01-28 01:52] <tokam> who is the author of the postinstall script?
[2024-01-28 02:03] <tokam> How can I impact the return values of phpquery -M -v 8.1 There seems to be an error
[2024-01-28 02:04] <athos> tokam: what is your package version?
[2024-01-28 02:04] <tokam> of?
[2024-01-28 02:04] <athos> php
[2024-01-28 02:04] <tokam> I removed everything from php and executed this apt-get install libapache2-mod-php
[2024-01-28 02:05] <tokam> I run into a severe error with the postinstall script of php8.1-cli and I fixed it dirty by disabling the exit code 1 in the file
[2024-01-28 02:06] <tokam> /usr/lib/php/php-maintscript-helper
[2024-01-28 02:06] <tokam> for the falsely generated phpenmod command in this line of the bash code "php$CMD" -m -v "$version" -s "$sapi" -q "$MOD" > /dev/null 2>&1 || return 1
[2024-01-28 02:07] <tokam> it's bellow this comment # coming here either means:
[2024-01-28 02:07] <athos> is this jammy, tokam ?
[2024-01-28 02:08] <tokam> but related to line 30 of this script https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/TJDmgQdNjJ/  /var/lib/dpkg/info/hp8.1-cli.postinst
[2024-01-28 02:08] <tokam> yes Release:	22.04
[2024-01-28 02:09] <tokam> I don't get the bash scripts 100 % but I guess the output of phpquery does not make sense? https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MJhgKPVqxS/
[2024-01-28 02:09] <rbox> theres nothing wrong with the script
[2024-01-28 02:10] <rbox> i was just able to isntal lthat package on a fresh 22.04 just fine
[2024-01-28 02:10] <rbox> so i take it back to
[2024-01-28 02:10] <rbox> [06:23:18 PM] <rbox> take a fresh system, and try to instal lit
[2024-01-28 02:10] <rbox> [06:23:20 PM] <rbox> does it still fail?
[2024-01-28 02:11] <tokam> rbox: what's your output for phpquery -M -v 8.1
[2024-01-28 02:12] <rbox> a long of stuff
[2024-01-28 02:12] <tokam> rbox: the script should work in all environments? and not just in fresh ones?
[2024-01-28 02:12] <rbox> well if you've pre broken your install
[2024-01-28 02:12] <rbox> who knowas
[2024-01-28 02:12] <tokam> rbox: you get -r in one line? can you paste?
[2024-01-28 02:12] <rbox> no -r
[2024-01-28 02:13] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MJhgKPVqxS/   I think line 6, 7, 10 , 11 and 19 just don't make sense
[2024-01-28 02:13] <tokam> but I don't get where they come from
[2024-01-28 02:13] <tokam> also 24 might be questionable (not sure)
[2024-01-28 02:18] <tokam> rbox: are you from windows? recommending a system reinstall for each small problem? :D
[2024-01-28 02:19] <ArchDave> https://pastebin.com/aaAH7dFr these are php8.1 packages
[2024-01-28 02:19] <tokam> so one question is why phpquery gives such weird output on my system.... for the php8.1-cli postinstall script it maybe should be changed to be able to handle/ignore it?
[2024-01-28 02:20] <rbox> because of the random things you've broken
[2024-01-28 02:20] <ArchDave> I would try removal with --purge, then re-install it
[2024-01-28 02:21] <ArchDave> Make sure to note what packages it says it's going to remove, tho
[2024-01-28 02:21] <tokam> okay this looks messy here, how is it possible I see more packages with dpkg -l | grep php than I see for php in synaptics?
[2024-01-28 02:21] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MsdgysxyFV/
[2024-01-28 02:21] <ArchDave> I don't know, I did it on a server install of 22.04 on a linode instance
[2024-01-28 02:22] <tokam> I removed everything php related in synaptics but in dkpg I still get this long list (from pastebin)
[2024-01-28 02:22] <ArchDave> oh, see all those lines that start with "rc  "? those are old packages, try a sudo apt autoremove
[2024-01-28 02:23] <tokam> 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
[2024-01-28 02:23] <tokam> maybe just configs?
[2024-01-28 02:24] <oerheks> no, packages held back, apt list --upgradable -a
[2024-01-28 02:24] <oerheks> Phased updates most likely
[2024-01-28 02:25] <tokam> I don't get it yet. Are these still installed?
[2024-01-28 02:25] <oerheks> time to do a fresh install, i see a lot of Sury ppa clutter man
[2024-01-28 02:25] <rbox> lol
[2024-01-28 02:26] <oerheks> no support for that wrecked install. use a ppa at your own risk.
[2024-01-28 02:26] <tokam> lol
[2024-01-28 02:26] <tokam> good night
[2024-01-28 02:26] <oerheks> you used this one https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php
[2024-01-28 02:27] <oerheks> one way could be: add it again, and use ppa-purge, to reverse
[2024-01-28 02:27] <tokam> thanks
[2024-01-28 02:27] <oerheks> i would do fresh, not worth the megawatt
[2024-01-28 02:27] <rbox> am i in a time loop
[2024-01-28 02:27] <rbox> i swear every few weeks
[2024-01-28 02:27] <rbox> ite the same crap, broken system, garbage ppas
[2024-01-28 02:27] <rbox> and "i dindt do anyting to break it"
[2024-01-28 02:27] <tokam> why the packages are not listed in synaptic?
[2024-01-28 02:28] <oerheks> well, there are significant differences with his packages. not compatible
[2024-01-28 02:28] <oerheks> tokam, as you removed that ppa, no lists are available to index
[2024-01-28 02:28] <tokam> could at least index what is installed?
[2024-01-28 02:29] <oerheks> no
[2024-01-28 02:29] <rbox> [07:22:51 PM] <ArchDave> oh, see all those lines that start with "rc  "? those are old packages, try a sudo apt autoremove
[2024-01-28 02:29] <rbox> they're not installed
[2024-01-28 02:29] <oerheks> good luck!
[2024-01-28 02:30] <tokam> I need to sleep now. Glad we got php somehow working... maybe I will dig deeper into what happened with the ppa and those packages after some sleep
[2024-01-28 02:30] <tokam> thank you guys a lot <3
[2024-01-28 02:30] <tokam> gn8
[2024-01-28 02:37] <ArchDave> Well!
[2024-01-28 02:38] <ArchDave> I had a hella lot of not fully removed linux kernels
[2024-01-28 02:43] <Bashing-om> ArchDave: Remove old config files too ' dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/{print $2}' | xargs sudo dpkg -P ' .
[2024-01-28 03:08] <ArchDave> it's already done
[2024-01-28 03:09] <ArchDave> was just noting it, I kinda though modern Ubuntu wouldn't leave those hanging around

[2024-01-28 06:28] <geek_> HI - i borked my Ubuntu 22.04, already spent too much time troubleshooting... (i THINK it was a update that borked me - maybe Nvidia driver issue) -- anyway i want to reinstall and keep all data in /home directory... i booted to "live USB Ubuntu 22.04" - i have attached a big NVME USB drive formatted to ext4 - i selected show hidden files - i tried the drag and drop of my entire /home folder only to hit endless "Error while copying." --
[2024-01-28 06:28] <geek_> The folder XXXXXX cannot be handled because you do not have permissions to read it... XXXXX = keyrings, xorg, .ssh, snap, .mozilla etc etc etc... i know this is a  permissions thing... i formatted the NVME USB drive using disks to ext4 (same as original borked install)  my user name in original install was Geek... How to i copy the files over AND then when fresh install copy them back without ERROR.... thanks
[2024-01-28 06:32] <arraybolt3> geek_: The problem you're running into is most likely because the user ID on the ilve USB is 999, and the user ID of your user on the installed system is 1000.
[2024-01-28 06:33] <arraybolt3> geek_: what I'd try is run `sudo su -` in a terminal to drop to a root shell, then run `cp -a /home /media/ubuntu/nvme_drive_here/`.
[2024-01-28 06:34] <arraybolt3> (replacing `nvme_drive_here` as appropriate)
[2024-01-28 06:34] <arraybolt3> That should copy everything and preserve permissions properly, and you'll avoid permissions problems.
[2024-01-28 06:35] <arraybolt3> As for restoring, it's *probably* a good idea to start by just restoring your data, and then hunt for and only restore specific config files when/if you need them. I've found that I don't need my config files most of the time (except for encryption keys), and you'll potentially save yourself headaches if you don't restore them right away.
[2024-01-28 06:35] <arraybolt3> *start by just restoring your normally used data, i.e. visible files
[2024-01-28 06:36] <geek_> arraybolt2 THANKS - and will that still work when i copy all the backed up /home files back into fresh install /home dir
[2024-01-28 06:36] <geek_> IF i use same Geek user name
[2024-01-28 06:36] <arraybolt3> once you're copying your backed-up files back, you *should* be able to drag-n-drop the visible ones into position.
[2024-01-28 06:36] <arraybolt3> If you *really* want to do a mass restore of everything (which I would highly recommend against), you can do that, but again, I'd recommend against doing that.
[2024-01-28 06:37] <geek_> i been reading alot about chmod to own the NVME drive -- but i dont get how to do it
[2024-01-28 06:38] <geek_> OK -- all i REALLY must have is all the qbittorrent data, config etc and i found the 3 folders that hold all that info
[2024-01-28 06:48] <geek_> arraybolt -- does this look correct: cp -a /media/ubuntu/UBUNTU 20.04 LTS/home /media/ubuntu/NVME  ??
[2024-01-28 06:57] <geek_> arraybolt3 -- oops i forget no spaces so i put quotes around --- this looks like its working cp -a /media/ubuntu/"UBUNTU 20.04 LTS"/home /media/ubuntu/NVME
[2024-01-28 06:58] <arraybolt3> ah, that looks more right than the one I gave, I forgot that /home was going to be somewhere else when booting from a live USB.
[2024-01-28 07:00] <geek_> THANKS arraybolt3 -- its copying now
[2024-01-28 07:00] <arraybolt3> glad to help!

[2024-01-28 09:39] <tokam> Good morning, hi oerheks hi rbox
[2024-01-28 09:39] <tokam> hi ArchDave
[2024-01-28 09:45] <tokam> I had this ppa active on ubuntu cosmic. Should I add the ppa for cosmic or for jammy?
[2024-01-28 09:45] <tokam> " (03:27:01) oerheks: one way could be: add it again, and use ppa-purge, to reverse"
[2024-01-28 09:49] <tesseract> hello. i am going to install snap on my system. but i am using raspberry pi os on a raspberry pi 5. as you know, it is arm. so, if i install snap and do "sudo snap install package-name" will install arm version automatically?
[2024-01-28 09:49] <tesseract> or should i do something different on arm device?
[2024-01-28 09:55] <tesseract> ok. i found that it is ok
[2024-01-28 09:55] <Paris> try the raspi channel, they have a dedicated channel
[2024-01-28 09:55] <Paris> either raspbian or ubuntu-something
[2024-01-28 09:55] <Paris> the particular version, cause they have specificities.
[2024-01-28 10:47] <Guest36> hello there! can someone help me to solve this issue? i have thinkpad laptop and when i close it with all open programs [not shutdown] after i can not awake laptop
[2024-01-28 11:46] <user666> Guest36: Disable sleep on lid closing. My old laptop also face similar issue, sleep completely borked in both linux and windows 10.
[2024-01-28 13:08] <tokam> I installed php-xml but the xml.ini does not appear in /etc/php/8.1/cli/mods-available
[2024-01-28 13:12] <younder> #php ?
[2024-01-28 13:12] <ravage> the config handling is done by ubuntu. the question is valid
[2024-01-28 13:12] <younder> More interested in laravel
[2024-01-28 13:13] <tokam> I have some issue with php on my ubuntu jammy. Yesterday I was told that a ppa that I used but removed is the reason
[2024-01-28 13:13] <ravage> if you did not remove all the packages from that PPA that may cause problrms
[2024-01-28 13:14] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/MsdgysxyFV/ I am a bit confused what these old packages are, what rc means? they are not listed in synaptic package manager
[2024-01-28 13:15] <ravage> this is the output on a fresh 22.04 LXC container when you install php-xml: https://p.haxxors.com/klqtjsp0.txt -> creates /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/xml.ini
[2024-01-28 13:16] <ravage> you can force all config files to be removed
[2024-01-28 13:16] <ravage> if that is not a problem
[2024-01-28 13:16] <tokam> I am thinking about running this command
[2024-01-28 13:16] <tokam> apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/ { print $2 }')
[2024-01-28 13:16] <ravage> yes that should do exactly that
[2024-01-28 13:17] <tokam> ravage for me it does not create this config file
[2024-01-28 13:17] <ravage> if you used a PPA make sure you remove all php related packages. purge the configs. install from ubuntu repos
[2024-01-28 13:17] <tokam> ravage I am sure there is some software included, that I like to keep
[2024-01-28 13:17] <tokam> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/FqbvbvVcyG/
[2024-01-28 13:17] <tokam> what does rc mean?
[2024-01-28 13:18] <ravage> configs from a removed but not purged package are still on your system
[2024-01-28 13:18] <ravage> none of those packages should be really installed on your system
[2024-01-28 13:18] <tokam> So I should go through the list
[2024-01-28 13:18] <ravage> you can check a few
[2024-01-28 13:19] <tokam> and if I don't see anything I need, I just run it?
[2024-01-28 13:19] <ravage> yes but as always: backups are key
[2024-01-28 13:19] <tokam> too late xD
[2024-01-28 13:20] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-28 13:20] <tokam> do I need to re-enable that ppa to clean up my system?
[2024-01-28 13:20] <ravage> you can use https://github.com/ericj112/ppa-tool/raw/master/ppa-tool.sh
[2024-01-28 13:21] <ravage> that should get all the ppa packages
[2024-01-28 13:22] <ravage> it could help to add it again yes. make sure alll packages are removed and then remove the ppa again
[2024-01-28 13:23] <tokam> even if it is for cosmic and not jammy?
[2024-01-28 13:23] <ravage> uh. maybe not
[2024-01-28 13:23] <ravage> i mean as long as you just enable it and dont try to install aynthing..
[2024-01-28 13:23] <tokam> so I need to add the ppa and run allpackages from that script?
[2024-01-28 13:24] <ravage> the tool should be able to tell you all packages installed from that ppa yes
[2024-01-28 13:27] <tokam> Error: ppa list file /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_ondrej_php_ubuntu_dists_cosmic_main_*_Packages doesn't exist, try apt-get update first
[2024-01-28 13:28] <ravage> the solution may be in the error message?
[2024-01-28 13:29] <tokam> ;-) waiting for the other apt command to terminate
[2024-01-28 13:40] <tokam> apt-get update did not help ravage
[2024-01-28 13:41] <ravage> you could just purge all php* packages
[2024-01-28 13:42] <ravage> what you want is a system that is hopefully clean of any php packages and then install the ubuntu repo ones
[2024-01-28 13:43] <tokam> ic  php5-gmp                                                    5.6.11+dfsg-1ubuntu3.2                      amd64        GMP module for php5
[2024-01-28 13:43] <tokam> This package is still listed with dkpg -l
[2024-01-28 13:43] <tokam> and in synaptic it is listed as not installed and I cannot install it there.
[2024-01-28 13:43] <ravage> so remove it
[2024-01-28 13:44] <ravage> you could also rename /etc/php to /etc/php.bak
[2024-01-28 13:44] <tokam> E: Package 'php5-gmp' has no installation candidate
[2024-01-28 13:44] <tokam> how can I remove it?
[2024-01-28 13:44] <ravage> and then install the php packages you need
[2024-01-28 13:44] <ravage> i dont think its a problem
[2024-01-28 13:44] <tokam> dpkg -r I guess
[2024-01-28 13:44] <ravage> you can try that yes
[2024-01-28 13:49] <tokam> how is it possible that xml.ini is not in mods-available after I reinstall the php-xml package?
[2024-01-28 13:52] <EriC^> tokam: maybe it's from another package that php-xml depends on, try "dpkg -S /path/to/xml.ini" to see the package it belongs to
[2024-01-28 13:54] <tokam> I am missing this file
[2024-01-28 13:54] <tokam> I only have it in /etc/php/8.1_backup/cli/mods-available
[2024-01-28 13:55] <EriC^> still it might show it if the package is still installed, try the path it used to is
[2024-01-28 13:55] <EriC^> !find xml.ini
[2024-01-28 13:55] <ubottu> File xml.ini found in php8.2-xml, texi2html
[2024-01-28 13:58] <tokam> why does my phpquery command output so weird errornous modules inline 7 and 8 ? https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/2c56yNMnV6/
[2024-01-28 13:58] <tokam> This makes the php8.1-cli postinstall script break and I need to manually mess around in the bash script to configure the package
[2024-01-28 13:58] <tokam> EriC^: what path should I use? The one where I expect the file which is missing?
[2024-01-28 13:59] <tokam> dpkg-query: no path found matching pattern /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/xml.in
[2024-01-28 14:03] <tokam> I removed everything php related and will now move the /etc/php folder
[2024-01-28 14:05] <tokam> install of php now worked without errors
[2024-01-28 14:07] <tokam> anything wrong here? https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BstGvP3NsV/
[2024-01-28 14:07] <tokam> moving the /etc/php fixed my phpquery command.
[2024-01-28 14:08] <tokam> but php-xml does still not add the xml.ini file
[2024-01-28 14:10] <ravage> if that is the only issue you can just create it
[2024-01-28 14:11] <ugnius> Hi, toying with WSL2... Cannot figure out how to enable pkexec GUI authorization for. I would like to use 'gedit admin:///some/root/file'. Can I shar a link to my post on ubuntu forums, it has more info?
[2024-01-28 14:11] <ravage> tokam: the content really is one line: extension=xml.so
[2024-01-28 14:12] <lotuspsychje> !ubuwin | ugnius
[2024-01-28 14:12] <ubottu> ugnius: Windows 10 and newer have a feature called "Windows Subsystem for Linux", which allows it to run Ubuntu (and other Linux distro) userspace programs without porting/recompliation. For installation instructions, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide
[2024-01-28 14:13] <ravage> ugnius: you can but i think that is a very WSL specific problem and im not sure if anyone runs WSL here. but give it a try.
[2024-01-28 14:13] <lotuspsychje> hmm we had a wsl channel before?
[2024-01-28 14:14] <ravage> i dont think so
[2024-01-28 14:14] <tokam> ravage I have this file in a backup, but I should not create it manually?
[2024-01-28 14:14] <ravage> tokam: why not?
[2024-01-28 14:15] <tokam> should come from the installer (if I have a working system?)
[2024-01-28 14:15] <ugnius> ravage: I would love to find community for WSL support, there was Discord channel once, but now it's kind of overtaken by spammers
[2024-01-28 14:17] <ugnius> My post is here: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2494822 anyway it was a long shot. It's I should ask for help from Windows guys?
[2024-01-28 14:17] <ravage> sadly that is a situation where a windows help channel would try to send you to a linux room and the other way around
[2024-01-28 14:18] <ugnius> thanks anyway, it's not that important, just an annoyance.
[2024-01-28 14:19] <tokam> I created this file manually and was able to enable the module
[2024-01-28 14:19] <tokam> but I would expect apt-get to create this file for me?
[2024-01-28 14:19] <ravage> you dont always get what you want i guess
[2024-01-28 14:19] <tokam> next issue is now with dom.xml
[2024-01-28 14:20] <tokam> But other clean systems don't have this issue?
[2024-01-28 14:20] <ravage> then maybe it is time to reinstall that system
[2024-01-28 15:04] <tokam> There must be some issue, why installing php packages with synaptic does not lead to the desired outcome ..
[2024-01-28 15:05] <tokam> for example I installed php-symfony-polyfill-mbstring but composer still gives me the error: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/hkTrfkrpVc/
[2024-01-28 15:05] <tokam> Could we somehow debug, why installations fail?
[2024-01-28 15:44] <tokam> Hi, I am having this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71209866/php-fatal-error-uncaught-error-class-normalizer-not-found-in-usr-share-php but php-intl is installed. Maybe something with regards to my php is still broken?
[2024-01-28 15:58] <dumpsterfire> How do I view files in the files browser? When I open up local files from Steam to view or edit them, they're in the path Home/snap/steam/common/.local/share, but when I click on the common portion to view its contents, it says "Folder is Empty," when it is not. The same thing happens when I'm trying to view anything in the Documents tab.
[2024-01-28 15:58] <xangua> dumpsterfire: Control+H to show hidden files
[2024-01-28 15:59] <leftyfb> dumpsterfire: type .local to navigate that that hidden directory
[2024-01-28 16:00] <dumpsterfire> Thanks. Just did ctrl+H and it worked for the common folder, but nothing is showing for the Documents folder. Are things not normally stored there?
[2024-01-28 16:05] <leftyfb> dumpsterfire: only if you put them there
[2024-01-28 16:06] <dumpsterfire> leftyfb thanks, wasn't sure what the game support meant when he said to look in the documents folder (he knows im using ubuntu), so maybe there was some miscommunication.
[2024-01-28 16:15] <JECICA202452> Voglia di figa giovane?

[2024-01-28 16:24] <tokam> after installing php-intl I don't see it in the output of phpinfo(). It seems something is a bit messed up with my php installation?
[2024-01-28 16:26] <user666> JECICA202452: this bi**h been spamming since yesterday..
[2024-01-28 16:29] <tokam> The extension was commented out in the php.ini and I fixed it.

[2024-01-28 17:22] <ph88> How can i clear my user account and personal files ?
[2024-01-28 17:24] <rbox> what do you mean clear
[2024-01-28 17:24] <rbox> you want to delete your files in your hoem dir? go ahead, nothing is stoppingyou
[2024-01-28 17:25] <ph88> clear as in the user account is like when i first setup the system  (but installed software, apps and updates can stay) just personal stuff needs to be fresh
[2024-01-28 17:26] <arraybolt3> ph88: Make a new user account with admin permissions.
[2024-01-28 17:26] <arraybolt3> Then log into it instead.
[2024-01-28 17:26] <ph88> alright thanks
[2024-01-28 17:27] <arraybolt3> You can copy data over from the old account with some effort, or just copy it onto a flash drive and then back into your new account as needed.
[2024-01-28 17:27] <arraybolt3> Or if you really don't need any of your old data (and you're absolutely sure of it), you can delete the old account and wipe its home folder.
[2024-01-28 17:27] <ph88> no data needs to get copied. I'm making the laptop ready for use by a friend, i don't use this laptop anymore
[2024-01-28 17:28] <arraybolt3> ah ok
[2024-01-28 17:29] <arraybolt3> hmm... how big of a deal is it if this friend uses an undelete application to recover your data?
[2024-01-28 17:29] <arraybolt3> ph88: ^
[2024-01-28 17:29] <arraybolt3> If it's a big deal, you should probably boot into the installer, zero out the disk, and reinstall from scratch.
[2024-01-28 17:29] <ph88> that's not needed i think but good advice in case i want to sell or something
[2024-01-28 17:29] <arraybolt3> ah kk
[2024-01-28 17:29] <arraybolt3> in that instance, you should be good.
[2024-01-28 20:58] <dawnbreaker> can somebody tell devs to add a yellow color to the theme switcher for next ubuntu? like a bright yellow
[2024-01-28 20:58] <dawnbreaker> that would be cool
[2024-01-28 20:59] <rbox> yeah, i'll get right on that
[2024-01-28 21:02] <_pragmaticenigma> dawnbreaker: This is just a volunteer operated support channel. If you want to propose changes, you can submit a bug to launchpad as a "wishlist" item, and maybe it'll get picked up.
[2024-01-28 21:03] <dawnbreaker> ah cool thanks _pragmaticenigma

[2024-01-29 02:54] <Macwinner> i have been running jammy hwe kernel for a while, but I think the most recent one has a bug with the i40e NIC driver
[2024-01-29 02:57] <Macwinner> seems to drop packets from a random host in my cluster.. across datacenters and hosting providers. The bug would start about 1hr after running fine.  I stopped nftables and still packets dropped. rmmod and modprobe i50e would fix the problem for a while
[2024-01-29 02:57] <Macwinner> downgrading to standard kernel seems to be running fine now

[2024-01-29 08:41] <tuklu> Subject: Seeking Help - SSH, Mounting, and Emergency Mode Issues on Ubuntu Server
[2024-01-29 08:41] <tuklu> Hello Ubuntu Chat Community,
[2024-01-29 08:41] <tuklu> I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently facing multiple challenges with my Ubuntu Server setup and would greatly appreciate your assistance and expertise.
[2024-01-29 08:41] <tuklu> Issue 1: SSH Connection Problem:
[2024-01-29 08:41] <tuklu> After a recent reboot, SSH connectivity to my server has become problematic. Despite no recent changes to the SSH configuration, connection attempts result in timeouts. I typically connect remotely via SSH and would like assistance in identifying and resolving this issue.
[2024-01-29 08:41] <tuklu> Issue 2: Mounting Problem with Plex Directory:

[2024-01-29 09:39] <Haris_> where do I find apache2.conf:115:User ${APACHE_RUN_USER} on 20.04 lts?
[2024-01-29 09:39] <Haris_> %s/where do I find/where am I going to find/
[2024-01-29 09:40] <drigy> Does anyone have exporience with ssh connection to a server? My ISP enabled IPv6 and now I am having some issues and cannot connect. Is there a somple way to enable ipv4 and v6 in my conf? I also added ssh pubkey and still not able to access
[2024-01-29 09:57] <charlie5> hi all ... after a fresh install of ubuntu with nvidia drivers installed, i find that the nvidia card is not being used ... do i have to do some extra config ? nvidia-xconfig perhaps ?
[2024-01-29 09:58] <charlie5> (the nvidia gpu is being used if i set 2 env vars, as per a web page i read)
[2024-01-29 10:04] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: what gives : sudo lshw -C video
[2024-01-29 10:18] <charlie5> lotuspsychje: i added a file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d containing   10-nvidia-dri-outputclass.conf   and now the gpu is being used
[2024-01-29 10:19] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: the nvidia driver should be picking up your card by default
[2024-01-29 10:20] <charlie5> lotuspsychje: that's what i thought :/
[2024-01-29 10:20] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: maybe a driver switch my fix a glitch
[2024-01-29 10:20] <charlie5> just a sec ... i'm chatting on another computer ..., so i can't paste stuff
[2024-01-29 10:21] <charlie5> i'll start pidgin on the computer in question
[2024-01-29 10:21] <lotuspsychje> you can use termbin if you like, pass the url from the other pic

[2024-01-29 10:27] <charlie5-laptop> hi lotuspsychje
[2024-01-29 10:29] <charlie5-laptop> this is the file i added from here ...  https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/ubuntu-20-04-does-not-use-nvidia-gpu/243803/2
[2024-01-29 10:29] <charlie5-laptop> btw, i'm on xubuntu if that makes a diff
[2024-01-29 10:29] <charlie5-laptop> see /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf    in that link
[2024-01-29 10:30] <charlie5-laptop> https://pastebin.com/KFK3aT8L    ... is the output of the lshw
[2024-01-29 10:31] <charlie5-laptop> that is with the above xorg.conf.d file added
[2024-01-29 10:31] <charlie5-laptop> (and gpu being used)
[2024-01-29 10:31] <mzoku> I have a Lenovo and there is Ubuntu and Zorin installed on it. I am trying to boot a new install of ubuntu from USB, but there is no HDD found. There is only eMMC card SandDisk 64GB -that is the actuall hard drive, but its not active and can't install anything on it
[2024-01-29 10:31] <mzoku> can you please help me with from where do I start fixing this?
[2024-01-29 10:32] <lotus|NUC> we can only support ubuntu and its !flavours here mzoku
[2024-01-29 10:33] <mzoku> lotus|NUC, ok, ignore that there is Zorin on it, it doesn't. Its just ubuntu.
[2024-01-29 10:35] <lotuspsychje> charlie5-laptop: i see you got hybrid graphics with amd/nvidia combo could be the culprit perhaps
[2024-01-29 10:36] <charlie5> ah, ok ... i didn't know the laptop had  amd gpu ... i thought it was just mesa
[2024-01-29 10:36] <charlie5> just mesa and nvidia
[2024-01-29 10:37] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: most cases use an intel/nvidia combo hybrid
[2024-01-29 10:37] <charlie5> lotuspsychje: was there something i should have done to prefer the nvidia gpu ?
[2024-01-29 10:37] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: what i would do is, switch nvidia driver and see if it glitches your manualy xorg trick
[2024-01-29 10:37] <charlie5> nvidia-xconfig ?
[2024-01-29 10:38] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: if not, checkout your dmesg logs to see whats going on
[2024-01-29 10:38] <charlie5> hokay ... not quite sure what you mean by  ' switch nvidia driver '
[2024-01-29 10:39] <lotuspsychje> charlie5: ubuntu-drivers list , would give you your available nvidia driver versions
[2024-01-29 10:41] <charlie5-laptop> oh, okay, so switch nvidia driver version ?
[2024-01-29 10:41] <lotuspsychje> charlie5-laptop: thats what i would do as a test yes
[2024-01-29 10:42] <pagios> can i ask an lvm question here
[2024-01-29 10:42] <charlie5-laptop> i'm using the proprietry nvidia driver atm   veriosn -535-generic
[2024-01-29 10:43] <lotuspsychje> charlie5-laptop: try one lower, if you have any?
[2024-01-29 10:45] <charlie5-laptop> lotuspsychje: there is a 525 version but it is appended with 'open', whatever that means
[2024-01-29 10:46] <charlie5-laptop> might be a few minutes
[2024-01-29 10:46] <charlie5-laptop> thanks for the help
[2024-01-29 10:46] <lotuspsychje> charlie5-laptop: if you cant get in your system, you can always try !nomodeset
[2024-01-29 10:47] <lotuspsychje> charlie5-laptop: or a recoverymode failsafe graphics
[2024-01-29 10:47] <lotuspsychje> !nomodeset
[2024-01-29 10:47] <ubottu> Systems with certain graphics chipsets may not boot properly out of the box. "Temporarily Add a Kernel Boot Parameter for Testing" as discussed at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters to add the "nomodeset" parameter there.

[2024-01-29 10:47] <ubottu> If your system fails to boot normally, it may be useful to boot it into recovery mode. For instructions, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode
[2024-01-29 10:54] <Haris_> I'm getting ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR from browser in a web app housed on 20.04 LTS with apache2. Does this make sense?
[2024-01-29 10:54] <Haris_> apache2 already has mod ssl enabled
[2024-01-29 10:54] <Haris_> do I need something else to make HTTPS traffic work on it?
[2024-01-29 10:55] <Haris_> %s#on#on/from#
[2024-01-29 11:00] <charlie5> hmm, lotuspsychje ... i just got my online game client working on the laptop ... the server is running on my desktop but they are talking via wan
[2024-01-29 11:00] <charlie5> it's kinda a breakthru
[2024-01-29 11:01] <charlie5> i'm not sure i want to mess with it much more atm :/
[2024-01-29 11:01] <charlie5> thanks a heap for the help so far
[2024-01-29 11:03] <Haris_> other than enabling SSL Module on apache on focal, do I need to do anything else to make SSL traffic work with apache?
[2024-01-29 11:04] <alumne_> hola
[2024-01-29 11:14] <Haris_> do I need to do something other than a2enmod ssl to have a proper working mod ssl in apache on focal?
[2024-01-29 11:24] <Haris_> guys, anyone around?
[2024-01-29 11:46] <Paris> seems no one know, better ask #apache with the ubuntu you usiung.
[2024-01-29 11:46] <Haris_> =)
[2024-01-29 12:54] <GeekShadow> Hello, I installed Ubuntu 22.04 with default Gnome on my computer in French, but I have some part untranslated...
[2024-01-29 12:54] <GeekShadow> eg : http://lutim.anartist.org/D1SPdCIm.jpg http://lutim.anartist.org/TXao9hGE.jpg
[2024-01-29 13:18] <plujon> On Ubuntu 16, why does `apt install g++-multilib` remove `g++-aarch64-linux-gnu`?  Is there some easier way to target x86_64, aarch64, and i686 on the same ubuntu host?
[2024-01-29 13:31] <ioria> plujon, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gcc-defaults/+bug/1300211
[2024-01-29 13:32] <ioria> plujon, some of the workaround might work
[2024-01-29 13:32] <plujon> ioria: Thanks; I'll take a look.
[2024-01-29 13:32] <ioria> ok
[2024-01-29 13:40] <BluesKaj> HI all
[2024-01-29 14:10] <pragmaticenigma> GeekShadow: You'll want to report that as a bug, or find an open ticket and add yourself as another affected user: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
[2024-01-29 14:17] <Haris_> I installed apache2 + mod ssl + with running apache as a custom linux user on focal. I'm getting when I browse an https based vhost -> https://dpaste.com/2NZ7LBJLD
[2024-01-29 14:18] <Haris_> my traffic is ending up on port 80, rather than on port 443
[2024-01-29 14:19] <joo> I have had many ubuntu computers over the years, and still do. One common problem is not being able to quickly save a file from firefox, thunderbird or other applications... the file save dialog tages 5-10 seconds to appear, and is quite slow like nautilus... Anybody knows of a solution ? I feel so stupid when my windows and os x collegues just saves a file in a folder from the internet.
[2024-01-29 14:37] <pragmaticenigma> Haris_: You may need to setup a "temporary redirect" on the port 80 configuration to forward clients/web browsers to the https. If you type in example.com to a web browser, by default the browser goes to the unsecured port 80
[2024-01-29 14:38] <Haris_> I have a permanent redirect already configured on the port http vhost
[2024-01-29 14:38] <Haris_> for going to https
[2024-01-29 14:40] <pragmaticenigma> Haris_: In my experience, you avoid permanent redirects. They cause more trouble than you may know. Your question may require more advanced help, have you tried #apache or #ubuntu-server?
[2024-01-29 14:40] <pragmaticenigma> *you should avoid
[2024-01-29 14:40] <Haris_> already on it
[2024-01-29 14:53] <dwigton_> If I make my own executables where should I put them on my machine to make them available to all users? It is ok to just dump in /usr/bin?
[2024-01-29 14:54] <leftyfb> dwigton_: /usr/local/bin/
[2024-01-29 14:55] <dwigton_> leftyfb: thanks
[2024-01-29 14:57] <pragmaticenigma> you can also use /opt if you want to keep the binary, config and datafiles in the same place
[2024-01-29 15:17] <webchat80> Have any of you used tripwire?
[2024-01-29 15:20] <Guest11> hi

[2024-01-29 15:21] <Guest11> did I make it to ubuntu chat
[2024-01-29 15:21] <Guest11> any of you use the software tripwire

[2024-01-29 15:26] <Guest11> So with that , I have a pop up personal ad that covers screen and does not go away
[2024-01-29 15:26] <leftyfb> Guest11: close your browser
[2024-01-29 15:29] <Guest11> iss it an opinion to ask,Â  does tripwire do the website suggests it will do?
[2024-01-29 15:30] <Guest11> is there a better way to verify that the boot sector or software has been tampered with
[2024-01-29 15:30] <Guest11> or even firmware
[2024-01-29 15:30] <leftyfb> Guest11: what release of ubuntu are you running?
[2024-01-29 15:30] <Guest11> I can change versions
[2024-01-29 15:31] <Guest11> 22.04 lts
[2024-01-29 15:31] <Guest11> I read that there was something recent having to do with the later versions and TPM 2.0
[2024-01-29 15:31] <leftyfb> Guest11: what exactly is your ubuntu support question?
[2024-01-29 15:32] <Guest11> Tripwire,,,Â  is there a better way to verify that the boot sector or software has been tampered with
[2024-01-29 15:32] <Guest11> I am awre of heads, for some computers which requires opening computer and hardware flashing
[2024-01-29 15:32] <leftyfb> Guest11: You're asking for suggestions and opinions on software, specifically security related. I would try #security

[2024-01-29 16:16] <plujon> After removing the failing drive, and using vanilla kernel boot parameters, my Ubuntu 22.04 LTS computer still sometimes fails to shut down fully.
[2024-01-29 16:17] <plujon> How can one troubleshoot this?  I know the computer is not fully shut down because the LED on the front and back of the computer stay on, as do the fans.  But the display goes dark.
[2024-01-29 16:20] <pragmaticenigma> plujon: Start jounalling what you are doing in your daily sessions, and note whether or not the system froze on shutdown. Look for a trend. If it is everytime you use a VM, perhaps the VM is hung in shutdown. Things like that.
[2024-01-29 16:23] <dreamcat4> hows it going guyss?
[2024-01-29 16:24] <dreamcat4> ... and any major system changes when upgrading from the 23.04 to the 23.10 or the 24.04 ?
[2024-01-29 16:24] <ravage> read the release notes
[2024-01-29 16:25] <dreamcat4> just debating whether to delay my upgrades proceedure until april. since its feb now only 2 more months
[2024-01-29 16:25] <dreamcat4> doesnt seem worth it to do it now. then to have to again so soon
[2024-01-29 16:26] <ravage> upgrades from 22.04 to 24.04 will be available with 24.04.1
[2024-01-29 16:26] <ravage> so not in april
[2024-01-29 16:26] <dreamcat4> i am on 23.04 though
[2024-01-29 16:26] <ravage> then you need to upgrade now because your release is EOL
[2024-01-29 16:27] <dreamcat4> ah yeah i do forget that always...
[2024-01-29 16:27] <dreamcat4> but i shall wait the 2 month anyhow. and do them both at once
[2024-01-29 16:27] <ravage> no
[2024-01-29 16:28] <ravage> you should not be online with a system without security updates for 2 months
[2024-01-29 16:28] <dreamcat4> for the sake of the disruption. it puts me out of business 1-2 days
[2024-01-29 16:28] <dreamcat4> oh i thought i still gets those (the security ones)
[2024-01-29 16:28] <ravage> have a backup. the upgrade takes maybe 30 mins
[2024-01-29 16:28] <ravage> no
[2024-01-29 16:28] <ravage> your release is EOL
[2024-01-29 16:29] <dreamcat4> ok thanks for informing me
[2024-01-29 16:53] <Guest68> Hello! For a while now my GNU screen has been very annoying. Opening nano in gnu screen blanks all characters after every 10% or so of cursor movements. I have to move cursor again to restore the characters.
[2024-01-29 16:54] <Guest68> I believe it is Ubuntu Server 23.10 fresh install. I botched an upgrade from a previous version and as such I might have left something from the old install somewhere... it's unclear what sparked this difference when it worked before.
[2024-01-29 16:57] <Guest68> It doesn't seem to be a problem with nano. The difference occurs any time I do any large scrolling action. Never seen it happen before
[2024-01-29 18:32] <aidenk> hello
[2024-01-29 18:46] <PeGaSuS> hello guys. if I `snap disable <snap name>` it isn't auto updated, etc, right?
[2024-01-29 18:47] <leftyfb> PeGaSuS: sudo snap refresh --hold <snap name>
[2024-01-29 18:48] <leftyfb> "disable" disables the application completely. As in, it can't be run
[2024-01-29 18:48] <PeGaSuS> gotcha! thanks
[2024-01-29 19:17] <ZFSonRootandEncr> Hey all, quick question. Through the GUI installation, is there a way to obtain ZFS on Root, and ZFS Native encryption enabled through a TPM Chip? It seems that they are not mutually inclusive, and the FDE doesn't allow me to also select ZFS (with a fTPM, waiting for a dTPM chip at the moment).
[2024-01-29 19:18] <ZFSonRootandEncr> Or vice-a-versa, I can't select ZFS and enable FDE
[2024-01-29 19:44] <mguy> 22.04.3 server, having problems getting cron jobs running for most users. same rules exist for all, what else could be causing `CRON[pid]: Permission denied` when running a job?
[2024-01-29 19:45] <mguy> pam_sss(cron:account): Access denied for user abc123: 6 (Permission denied)
[2024-01-29 19:47] <EriC^^> mguy: what's the command you're using?
[2024-01-29 19:47] <mguy> EriC^^: The 'cron job' is just `touch /tmp/username`, it works if I hot-wire cron by moving pam_sss.so towards the top and making it `sufficient`
[2024-01-29 19:48] <mguy> in /etc/pam.d/cron
[2024-01-29 19:48] <EriC^^> ah no idea
[2024-01-29 19:48] <mguy> My user and another user can run them without issue, we are both in the admin group on the ipa server we are using
[2024-01-29 19:49] <mguy> But there are rules for the other users (all users actually) on the ipa server and they pass hbactest
[2024-01-29 19:55] <leftyfb> mguy: hbactest is not available on ubuntu and I don't think freeipad server is anymore either
[2024-01-29 19:56] <mguy> freeipa-common/jammy,now 4.9.8-1 all [installed,automatic
[2024-01-29 19:56] <mguy> The command is `ipa hbactest`
[2024-01-29 19:57] <leftyfb> why not use systemd timers instead of cron?
[2024-01-29 19:58] <mguy> Because I have users that were using cronjobs on the previous server
[2024-01-29 20:10] <derek-shnosh> Ubuntu 23.10 - multi-display dissimilar resolution/scaling and individual app scaling. Laptop with built in display at 3072x1920@120hz 200% scaling, external display at 3440x1440@160hz 100% scaling. Gnome apps, like Files, adjust scaling properly when dragging from one display to another. Other apps like Hexchat, Joplin, and MS-Edge (I know, I know, work stuff) stay at 200% scaling when dragged to the external display.
[2024-01-29 20:10] <derek-shnosh> This includes their title bars, etc.
[2024-01-29 20:12] <derek-shnosh> ... Firefox (via apt) works fine, that is, changes scale appropriately when dragging between displays.
[2024-01-29 20:12] <pragmaticenigma> derek-shnosh: are you in a wayland or X11 session?
[2024-01-29 20:12] <derek-shnosh> Oh, using wayland.
[2024-01-29 20:14] <derek-shnosh> Noticing now that the right-click context menu (on desktop) on the external (100% scaling) display is very large as well.
[2024-01-29 20:14] <pragmaticenigma> derek-shnosh: are you able to try running an X11 session and see if the problem exists there? (I believe the issue you're having is a known issue with apps not being wayland ready and running under xwayland)
[2024-01-29 20:15] <derek-shnosh> I can try in X11 yeah... will have to live with it if that's the solution, I don't get the same _smooth_ experience in X11 than I have in Wayland. I love high refresh.
[2024-01-29 20:15] <derek-shnosh> Standby.
[2024-01-29 20:18] <derek-shnosh> pragmaticenigma: seems to be a bit worse on X11. Now I can't seem to set different scale % per display.
[2024-01-29 20:18] <derek-shnosh> When I change external to 100%, the built-in display also changes.
[2024-01-29 20:18] <derek-shnosh> And vice versa.
[2024-01-29 20:19] <pragmaticenigma> You might need ... ... ...
[2024-01-29 20:20] <derek-shnosh> pragmaticenigma: woops, client quit.
[2024-01-29 20:20] <pragmaticenigma> derek-shnosh: was about to mention you might need fractional scaling enabled in X11 https://askubuntu.com/a/1195175
[2024-01-29 20:21] <derek-shnosh> pragmaticenigma: gotcha, I will have to look into that, bookmarked the link.
[2024-01-29 20:22] <pragmaticenigma> derek-shnosh: lots of active development for wayland still going on fortunately. probably just a matter of time until everything shakes out and everyone plays nice :)
[2024-01-29 20:26] <derek-shnosh> pragmaticenigma: actually that link was helpful. In wayland I was able to use dconf-editor to modify /org/gnome/mutter/experimental-features and put the value ['scale-monitor-framebuffer'] in and save.
[2024-01-29 20:26] <pragmaticenigma> cool, was just about to suggest that for a wayland session, see if it helps :)
[2024-01-29 20:27] <derek-shnosh> There are some oddities with the cursor size when at the edges of windows (to resize them). But I can live with it because I'm not often in this workspace.
[2024-01-29 20:27] <derek-shnosh> Thanks very much for your response and helpful link!
[2024-01-29 20:28] <pragmaticenigma> you're welcome
[2024-01-29 21:06] <yousef> Yousefmouse1@
[2024-01-29 22:44] <Kangarooo> HUGE problem. I did updates for kUbuntu i didnt do for maybe almoust year and since i have autologin i now i have only mouse and no icons, desktop or panels. And in tty it doesnt recognize password spacebar or maybe i had different password.
[2024-01-29 22:44] <Kangarooo> many people can be affected
[2024-01-29 22:46] <arraybolt3> Kangarooo: Try pressing Alt+F2.
[2024-01-29 22:46] <arraybolt3> That should give you a KRunner place to type commands.
[2024-01-29 22:46] <arraybolt3> If that works, type `plasmashell` (without the backticks) and press Enter.
[2024-01-29 23:23] <Muligan> hey folks, kinda rusty on my FTP skills
[2024-01-29 23:23] <Muligan> have a local user establisehd, able to FTP into this server, but unable to create files/folders in targeted directory
[2024-01-29 23:23] <Muligan> suggestions?
[2024-01-29 23:24] <pragmaticenigma> does the user have the correct file system permissions to create objects in the shared directory? Either group or user level?
[2024-01-29 23:24] <Muligan> running vsftpd, 'write_enable=yes' is uncommented
[2024-01-29 23:25] <Muligan> yes, i've given chown perms to said filder
[2024-01-29 23:25] <Muligan> folder
[2024-01-29 23:25] <Muligan> it resides in their own /home/test_user directory
[2024-01-29 23:25] <Muligan> only thing that I haven't enabled on this server is 'chroot_local_user=yes'
[2024-01-29 23:26] <Muligan> very plain jane install here...
[2024-01-29 23:27] <pragmaticenigma> This might be a side note, but why FTP and not SFTP?
[2024-01-29 23:28] <Muligan> legacy equipment upgrades
[2024-01-29 23:28] <Muligan> I've checked w/winscp from my workstation for sftp, and i'm getting a diff error
[2024-01-29 23:29] <Muligan> 'Received SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA for nonexistent channel 0'
[2024-01-29 23:30] <Muligan> wow
[2024-01-29 23:30] <Muligan> sure doesn't help that I missed checking available disk space on this thing
[2024-01-29 23:31] <leftyfb> Muligan: I suggest not using FTP. Use sftp instead
[2024-01-29 23:31] <Muligan> I agree, whole heartedly
[2024-01-29 23:31] <Muligan> and I'll be working towards that for sure
[2024-01-29 23:34] <Muligan> even still with sftp, unable to write
[2024-01-30 00:04] <pragmaticenigma> Muligan: so low/no disk space is the issue it sounds like?
[2024-01-30 00:05] <Muligan> i've tried to upload even a 1kb file

[2024-01-30 04:15] <constxqt> it's over
[2024-01-30 04:16] <constxqt> i don't understand how i'm supposed to upgrade from 22.10
[2024-01-30 04:16] <constxqt> tried following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[2024-01-30 04:16] <constxqt> downloaded the specific upgrade tool for mantic
[2024-01-30 04:16] <constxqt> >upgrade from kinetic to mantic isn't supported using this tool
[2024-01-30 04:17] <constxqt> i can't `apt update`, can't `apt upgrade`, can't `do-release-upgrade`, can't use the mantic-specific upgrade tool
[2024-01-30 04:17] <constxqt> this is deranged
[2024-01-30 04:17] <bparker> >using a non-LTS version
[2024-01-30 04:18] <constxqt> i didn't mean to i just used the default digitalocean droplet distro at the time i think
[2024-01-30 04:18] <constxqt> i didn't ask for this suffering
[2024-01-30 04:19] <mybalzitch> what does do-release-upgrade complain about specifically
[2024-01-30 04:19] <mybalzitch> pastebin please
[2024-01-30 04:20] <mybalzitch> have you tried 22.10 -> 23.04 -> 23.10 ?
[2024-01-30 04:21] <constxqt> trying that now, i think it's working
[2024-01-30 04:21] <constxqt> what version should i be on right now
[2024-01-30 04:21] <constxqt> to minimize this kind of nightmare in the future
[2024-01-30 04:22] <constxqt> how can a version newer than the *newest* LTS release be end of life
[2024-01-30 04:23] <constxqt> seems like i should be downgrading to 22.04, not upgrading at all
[2024-01-30 08:57] <kmikita> I have partitions in my system mounted via /etc/fstab to points /data0 /data1 /data2, etc. The snap applications does not allow me to read and write from them (symlinks through the home dir do not help). I guess it might be related to the apparmor. Please tell me how to fix it.
[2024-01-30 09:41] <AmeliaMonaldo> hey there
[2024-01-30 09:42] <AmeliaMonaldo> hey there

[2024-01-30 09:51] <AmeliaMonaldo> https://bdcash1.scaletrk.com/click?o=4422&a=6309
[2024-01-30 10:48] <ogra_> kmikita, mount them in /mnt or /media then at least every snap that has the removable-media interface enabled can access them ... if you need more, stop using symlinks and switch to bind mounts, apparmor can not support symlinks, but bind mounts do work
[2024-01-30 10:49] <kmikita> ogra_, thanks for the answer
[2024-01-30 10:50] <kmikita> ogra_, can I edit apparmour profile to allow access to manual mount point?
[2024-01-30 10:57] <ogra_> kmikita, no, apparmor profiles for snaps are generated on the fly ... they would just eb overwritten
[2024-01-30 10:57] <ogra_> s/eb/be/
[2024-01-30 10:59] <kmikita> ogra_, Thanks again! This is an exhaustive answer. I will use the bind mounts.

[2024-01-30 11:21] <Beladona> I use ubuntu, did `apt purge openjdk-jdk` but `java --version` still prints the version. `which java` gives /usr/bin/java. How can I remove?
[2024-01-30 11:25] <Beladona> even tried `defaultjdk-jdk`
[2024-01-30 11:25] <oerheks> openjdk will be running until you reboot, but ...openjdk is a core tool
[2024-01-30 11:25] <oerheks> why remove that:?
[2024-01-30 11:30] <Beladona> oerheks: ok, how to kill it?
[2024-01-30 11:31] <Beladona> also I get this on apt. Which file should I remove https://pastebin.mozilla.org/to69bcij#L4
[2024-01-30 11:32] <oerheks> how to kill it; reboot and it should be gone.
[2024-01-30 11:33] <Beladona> cannot reboot server
[2024-01-30 11:34] <oerheks> from that paste, remove old kernels?
[2024-01-30 11:34] <oerheks> sudo apt --purge autoremove
[2024-01-30 11:34] <oerheks> and reboot
[2024-01-30 11:37] <Beladona> oerheks: sudo rm -rf /boot/System.map-5*  ?
[2024-01-30 11:38] <oerheks> no, if you are on ubuntu; sudo apt --purge autoremove
[2024-01-30 11:39] <Beladona> what if i just remove the old kernel files?
[2024-01-30 11:40] <oerheks> do as you like, i am not going to repeat.
[2024-01-30 11:41] <oerheks> that command does what you ask for, remove old kernels and parts
[2024-01-30 11:42] <Beladona> repeating or responding is a choice of anyone who wants to participate in a chat. You don't have an obligation to. That command didn't do the expected in past or maybe I am mistaken. Will run it.
[2024-01-30 11:43] <Beladona> I did both rm and purge autoremove. looks like it works. thanks
[2024-01-30 11:44] <ogra_> note that a plain rm could always confuse the packaging system ... depending how bad the deb is packed, to a point where you break the system ... so better use apt/deb to remove any files owned by a package
[2024-01-30 13:15] <Beladona> ogra_: ok. actually I already used rm. anyt remedy now?
[2024-01-30 13:40] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[2024-01-30 13:43] <ogra_> Beladona, that was rather a general statement (dont delete files that are meant to be handled via packages), i'd expect the kernel packaging to be good enough to deal with missing files though
[2024-01-30 14:01] <spinningCat> how can i solve this problem https://dpaste.com/2EHW3JNFK
[2024-01-30 14:02] <leftyfb> spinningCat: remove the 3rd party repository and the packages associated with it
[2024-01-30 14:15] <spinningCat> Warning: Invalid locale (please review locale settings, this might lead to problems later):
[2024-01-30 14:15] <spinningCat>   locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid
[2024-01-30 14:16] <spinningCat> i got this because of some unofficial packages?
[2024-01-30 14:19] <oerheks> spinningCat, yes, most likely the nodejs repo
[2024-01-30 14:20] <oerheks> one could try to regenerate locales,  sudo locale-gen "tr_TR.UTF-8" && sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
[2024-01-30 14:21] <spinningCat> okay
[2024-01-30 14:21] <spinningCat> thanks
[2024-01-30 14:31] <spinningCat> https://dpaste.com/D3SP97WU8 i got this now i need to install nodejs
[2024-01-30 14:32] <leftyfb> spinningCat: sudo apt remove --purge nodejs*
[2024-01-30 14:32] <leftyfb> then remove the repository
[2024-01-30 14:32] <leftyfb> then install nodejs from the official ubuntu repo
[2024-01-30 14:33] <spinningCat> official ubuntu repo has 12 i need 16
[2024-01-30 14:34] <leftyfb> spinningCat: why do you need 16?
[2024-01-30 14:34] <spinningCat> well i am using prisma
[2024-01-30 14:34] <spinningCat> and prisma orm request version 16 or above
[2024-01-30 14:35] <leftyfb> spinningCat: You can install Ubuntu 12.10 which has nodejs 18.13
[2024-01-30 14:35] <leftyfb> spinningCat: other than that, you'll have to reach out to the 3rd party repository for support with their repo
[2024-01-30 14:36] <spinningCat> libnode72:amd64 can i remove this?
[2024-01-30 14:36] <leftyfb> I would
[2024-01-30 14:37] <spinningCat> this cause the problem
[2024-01-30 14:38] <leftyfb> the 3rd party repo/packages cause the problem, yes
[2024-01-30 14:38] <spinningCat> i used that repos i didnt encounter problem before
[2024-01-30 14:38] <leftyfb> and now you do
[2024-01-30 14:39] <spinningCat> seems weird :D
[2024-01-30 14:40] <spinningCat> nice
[2024-01-30 14:40] <spinningCat> removing libnode72 did smmoth things out
[2024-01-30 14:41] <spinningCat> thanks for sharing your time i appreciated

[2024-01-30 20:52] <sarnold> Beladona: truncate the huge files, just a quick "> /boot/System.map-whatever" at bash would do the trick
[2024-01-30 20:52] <sarnold> Beladona: then you'll have enough free space on the filesystem to purge the package properly
[2024-01-30 22:09] <oerheks> sarnold, and update grub i guess
[2024-01-30 22:16] <sreve> Hi there. My desktop environment (xfce) is totally broken. I don't know what happened:( ... Can someone tell me how to reset it to a fresh install?
[2024-01-30 22:17] <leftyfb> sreve: start by creating a new user and seeing if logging in as that new user resolves your issues
[2024-01-30 22:23] <sreve> leftyfb, ok a new user works well.
[2024-01-30 22:23] <sreve> last thing I have done is to install open-shot and shotcut.
[2024-01-30 22:24] <leftyfb> sreve: ok, then I would suggest moving ~/.config/<some fxce specific directory> maybe to your ~/ for the main user and try logging back in
[2024-01-30 22:24] <sreve> and for some reason chrome is the new browser ... not firefox.

[2024-01-30 22:35] <sreve> leftleg_, the problem was the multi screen setup.

[2024-01-31 01:24] <querulant> moin, alle sprachen auf diesem kanal ?

[2024-01-31 02:47] <blei> i wanna stamp the top right corner of every page of a pdf with the year but i cant figure it out the text is always blurry
[2024-01-31 07:10] <aiena> In ubuntu with Alt+F2 how do I execute a shell script vs opening it in the text editor?
[2024-01-31 07:22] <Bashing-om> aiena: Have you mafe the script "executable" > chmod ?
[2024-01-31 07:22] <Bashing-om> made*
[2024-01-31 07:23] <aiena> the script is executable but alt+f2 opens the text editor running it in a terminal emulator launches it.
[2024-01-31 07:23] <aiena> A workaround I found is making a .desktop file launch the script
[2024-01-31 07:23] <aiena> But wondering if I could get by without it.
[2024-01-31 07:24] <aiena> using the .desktop method I press the show applications and search and launch which works too but differently

[2024-01-31 11:41] <geirha> you mean glibc? you can check    apt changelog libc6   and see if it mentions the cve numbers

[2024-01-31 11:53] <bjorkintosh> whatever happened to just running apt to update?
[2024-01-31 11:55] <lotuspsychje> bjorkintosh: see bug #2047778
[2024-01-31 11:56] <ravage> the easy fix it to enable pro ð

[2024-01-31 11:56] <bjorkintosh> this is sacred ground :-|
[2024-01-31 11:57] <ravage> you still get all updates via apt with pro
[2024-01-31 11:57] <ravage> not sure what this has to do with microsoft
[2024-01-31 11:59] <bjorkintosh> ravage, does pro not require registering with ubuntu?

[2024-01-31 12:01] <ravage> thats the FAQ. read it and decide yourself
[2024-01-31 12:01] <ravage> if you dont want to use pro wait for the bugfix in the updater
[2024-01-31 12:02] <bjorkintosh> lotuspsychje, maybe it isn't registered for pro updates.
[2024-01-31 12:02] <bjorkintosh> ravage, thank you. I'll wait.

[2024-01-31 15:34] <leftyfb> tuxinator: I don't think it's supported in Ubuntu 22.04
[2024-01-31 15:35] <leftyfb> I determined that by the lack of any package including the homectl binary
[2024-01-31 15:40] <CosmicDJ> tuxinator: I have my $HOME encrypted with fscrypt on mantic, it's decrypted when I enter my login password using PAM

[2024-01-31 15:43] <JordiGH> How do you get security upgrades without Ubuntu Paid?
[2024-01-31 15:44] <leftyfb> :/
[2024-01-31 15:44] <leftyfb> JordiGH: Ubuntu is free
[2024-01-31 15:46] <JordiGH> leftyfb: Okay, how do I get free security upgrades?
[2024-01-31 15:47] <leftyfb> !update | JordiGH
[2024-01-31 15:47] <leftyfb> JordiGH: sudo apt upgrade
[2024-01-31 15:47] <leftyfb> JordiGH: or with the desktop, a window should pop up periodically showing you updates and allowing you to update them
[2024-01-31 15:48] <JordiGH> leftyfb: It's asking me to pay or signup for something in order to get security upgrades.
[2024-01-31 15:48] <leftyfb> !pro | JordiGH
[2024-01-31 15:48] <leftyfb> hm, ubottu broken?
[2024-01-31 15:48] <itu> how to not open new instance of hexchat when clicking to the icon in left dashboard
[2024-01-31 15:49] <leftyfb> JordiGH: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-pro-faq/34042
[2024-01-31 15:49] <leftyfb> JordiGH: that is Ubuntu pro. You can subscribe for free here: https://ubuntu.com/pro/subscribe
[2024-01-31 15:50] <JordiGH> Okay, if I don't want to subscribe, I'm still not getting security upgrades?
[2024-01-31 15:50] <JordiGH> That FAQ is tl;dr
[2024-01-31 15:50] <leftyfb> JordiGH: if you read the article, it explains your question perfectly
[2024-01-31 15:50] <JordiGH> It's way too long.
[2024-01-31 15:50] <leftyfb> JordiGH: you will still get security updates without subscribing to pro
[2024-01-31 15:51] <JordiGH> So why is it saying it's not doing security upgrades?
[2024-01-31 15:51] <leftyfb> it's not
[2024-01-31 15:52] <JordiGH> Ugh, it's a simple question: how do I get those security upgrades without Ubuntu Pro?
[2024-01-31 15:52] <JordiGH> Answer: this is how
[2024-01-31 15:52] <JordiGH> Altenrative answer: you cannot
[2024-01-31 15:52] <leftyfb> you don't
[2024-01-31 15:52] <JordiGH> Okay, thanks.
[2024-01-31 15:52] <messi> hola
[2024-01-31 15:52] <messi> hola
[2024-01-31 15:52] <messi> holaaaaaaaaaa
[2024-01-31 15:53] <leftyfb> JordiGH: Ubuntu pro is Canonical (commercial business) doing security updates to what are normally community maintained packages. If the community maintainer hasn't updated the package, then Canonical might as part of the Pro subscription.
[2024-01-31 15:54] <JordiGH> This is some of the dumbest things Marky Mark has done.
[2024-01-31 15:54] <leftyfb> JordiGH: that doesn't mean you won't get the updates. It just might mean you have to wait longer for the maintainer to update their package. Maybe.
[2024-01-31 15:54] <JordiGH> "Hey, we know how to make sure you don't get pwned, but you have to give us stuff to not get pwned? Don't wanna do it? Get pwned, n00b!"
[2024-01-31 15:54] <leftyfb> JordiGH: It sounds like you still don't understand what pro is and don't seem to have an interest in understanding. Good luck
[2024-01-31 15:55] <JordiGH> I am working at a company. I don't qualify for the free thing.
[2024-01-31 15:55] <leftyfb> JordiGH: that's not necessarily true
[2024-01-31 15:55] <JordiGH> If I want to keep this thing secure, I'm going to have to go through some internal bureaucracy to pay for it.
[2024-01-31 15:55] <JordiGH> In the meantime, my computer has known vulns.
[2024-01-31 15:55] <leftyfb> JordiGH: again, that's not necessarily true
[2024-01-31 15:55] <JordiGH> This is dumb, Mark.
[2024-01-31 15:56] <JordiGH> sabdfl come back to IRC you coward
[2024-01-31 15:56] <leftyfb> also, this is for community packages. Not typically ones tha you'll be using in an enterprise environment
[2024-01-31 15:56] <leftyfb> JordiGH: knock it off
[2024-01-31 16:00] <JordiGH> leftyfb: Also, obscuring all this with a wall of text of corporate-sounding PR nonsense is infuriating.
[2024-01-31 16:00] <leftyfb> JordiGH: or you could read the article I posted to get a better understanding of what Pro is and isn't
[2024-01-31 16:01] <JordiGH> I understand now what it is. Maybe pay for security fixes, or do nothing and live with known vulns.
[2024-01-31 16:01] <JordiGH> It's damn near extorsion.
[2024-01-31 16:01] <leftyfb> JordiGH: do you know what community packages are?
[2024-01-31 16:01] <JordiGH> The Debian packages that Ubuntu cares less about.
[2024-01-31 16:02] <ioria> kinda :)
[2024-01-31 16:02] <leftyfb> they are packages maintained by the community. Not Canonical
[2024-01-31 16:02] <JordiGH> By Debian.
[2024-01-31 16:02] <JordiGH> Not "the community".
[2024-01-31 16:02] <leftyfb> false
[2024-01-31 16:03] <JordiGH> Debian has a well-architected structure.
[2024-01-31 16:03] <JordiGH> Okay, fine, you can also patch downstream in Ubuntu, but mostly you don't
[2024-01-31 16:03] <leftyfb> The vast majority of packages in Ubuntu are directly from Debian. That doesn't make them community packages
[2024-01-31 16:04] <ioria> as i remember the subscript is for free JordiGH
[2024-01-31 16:04] <JordiGH> ioria: Depends who you are. I'm pretty sure I don't qualify.
[2024-01-31 16:04] <ioria> ho
[2024-01-31 16:05] <leftyfb> JordiGH: it depends
[2024-01-31 16:05] <JordiGH> We're a large company with more than 50 users. I could lie, I guess. Maybe that's ethical given the circumstances, but then my coworkers would be living with vulns instead.
[2024-01-31 16:06] <JordiGH> Well, medium company, really. Less than one kilousers.
[2024-01-31 16:07] <leftyfb> JordiGH: Canonical is updating packages belonging to someone else. Packages it doesn't maintain. For the betterment of it's users. For a cost. The rest of the entire OS from Ubuntu is free
[2024-01-31 16:08] <leftyfb> JordiGH: before Pro, nobody seemed to care that these packages weren't updated by their maintainers and installed them anyway. Where was the outrage then?
[2024-01-31 16:09] <leftyfb> that said, it's really really annoying the way Canonical is now bringing it to light in the manner they are. There's lots of discussions on how this could be done in a less intrusive and less alarming way
[2024-01-31 16:10] <leftyfb> (but also, not always at a cost)
[2024-01-31 16:10] <JordiGH> leftyfb: Dude, it doesn't matter. It's fucking sleazy to say "I know how to make sure you don't get pwned, but you have to pay." It's up there with "nice OS you got there. 'Twould be a shame if you got a ransomware attack on that."
[2024-01-31 16:11] <arraybolt3> !language | JordiGH
[2024-01-31 16:11] <leftyfb> JordiGH: ok, feel free to file a bug. Let us know if you have any actual support questions. If you'd like to discuss further, please /join #ubuntu-offtopic
[2024-01-31 16:11] <JordiGH> I wonder how long until that happens. It's a huge exposure vector. The vulns are exposed but because they're quasi-paywalled, a bunch of people will get attcked.
[2024-01-31 16:12] <arraybolt3> JordiGH: If you'd like to do all that work for free and give it away, you're more than welcome to :)
[2024-01-31 16:13] <JordiGH> I'm not against money. Hell, I love money. It's great to get paid. Everyone should get paid. But Mark chose a very bad way to get paid.
[2024-01-31 16:14] <leftyfb> JordiGH: feel free to discuss further in #ubuntu-offtopic. This channel is for Ubuntu support questions. Not to rant and argue.

[2024-01-31 16:29] <FKAShinobi> I have a service that is often timing out on 127.0.0.1. How do I tell if that is network related or for some other reason?
[2024-01-31 16:30] <lotuspsychje> elaborate a bit FKAShinobi
[2024-01-31 16:30] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi: can you pastebin the exact error message and maybe explain what service?
[2024-01-31 16:37] <FKAShinobi> lotuspsychje leftfb: https://paste.debian.net/1305892/     The service is unbound.
[2024-01-31 16:37] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi: that means you don't have a resolver listening on localhost or it's blocked
[2024-01-31 16:38] <leftyfb> at port 5335
[2024-01-31 16:40] <FKAShinobi> leftyfb: When the command is issued the first attempt it makes times out, then it does not. The service is enabled and active on port 5335
[2024-01-31 16:41] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi: look through the unbound logs
[2024-01-31 16:42] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi: I would suggest maybe asking for more help with unbound in #unbound. The people there should be pretty well versed and experienced with unbound
[2024-01-31 16:43] <FKAShinobi> leftyfb: fair enough. I was trying to determine if it was an appication issue or a networking issue. Do you know if the loopback address can ever timeout due to networking reasons?
[2024-01-31 16:44] <leftyfb> FKAShinobi: not likely unless you have blocked it or messing with it in some way with firewall rules
[2024-01-31 16:45] <FKAShinobi> leftyfb: Thanks

[2024-01-31 18:02] <Patrick_> I uninstalled a snap with the snap gui application and data belonging to that snap was automatically compressed with gzip. Does anyone know where that gzip file is stored?
[2024-01-31 18:16] <Patrick_> I figured it out. snapshots are saved in /var/lib/snapd/snapshots
[2024-01-31 18:16] <tupni> nice
[2024-01-31 18:16] <Patrick_> that's something to be mindful of, since sometimes an app can have a large amount of data
[2024-01-31 18:16] <tupni> make a backup in case some cleaning-agent scrubs it away
[2024-01-31 18:16] <Patrick_> I wanted it gone
[2024-01-31 18:17] <tupni> oh ok
[2024-01-31 18:18] <Patrick_> `snap saved` to list snapshots. `snap forget <set_number>` to delete it.
